i fell hard, on my first time in town, for her eyes and insoluble frown. then her caramel skin just kept drawing me in: soft and tawny, with fine golden down. 
the old minesweeper sailed by cousteau took him places we'd all love to go. she stood by him so long, that calypso of song, both as symbol and part of the show.

as usual, grannie looks miffed because grandpa's beginning to drift. his attention's out yonder, his discourses wander: "i'm excursive," he claims. "it's a gift." 
a direct light is harsh, even mean; we'll reflect it instead off a screen. and with two mature leads, this will fill the shot's needs? gentle bounce light will soften the scene. 
certain concepts are set in the brain. they're assumed; you'd dispute them in vain. in forensics, tacticians use presuppositions. their enthymemes leave out what's plain. 
she's an earth goddess, zaftig and stout, well-upholstered and padded throughout. is she fertile? why ask? sure, she's up for the task, and maternal ? what woman's about. 
there's careenage close by, so don't dock her. instead, let's go beach her and chock her. once her hull has been cleaned and her prop's been machined, we'll get plastered, then paint and re-stock her, 
applied arts produce items we use, from teapots to toques to tattoos. one aesthetically pleasing device is for squeezing; another's for polishing shoes. 
bored commuters want something to read, because eye contact's foolish, indeed. subway ads do the trick. car card messages stick. riders notice them; that's guaranteed. 
a scheduling conflict's a pain: for my barbecue, god scheduled rain, so i chose a new date; bad idea, tempting fate? an earthquake! god's yanking my chain. 
this fungus tastes great; have a seat? so like poultry you might think it's meat. fully cooked, it's the goods: sauteed chicken of the woods fried with shallots and eggs is a treat. 
in a rut? under stress? reassess. sample ranch life, kick back, decompress. ride our ranges, unwind; leave the pressure behind. at estancias dudes convalesce. 
that mushroom with gills 'neath its cap could be yummy but might be a trap. so you're famished? voracious? that thing's agaricaceous, and may start a permanent nap. 
"that's a conodont, son, like an eel." "sure, he's skinny, but how does he feel? what's he feeling within?" "he's just teeth and some skin, son?extinct. he's not even a meal." 
mom's kitchen, of town-wide repute, smells of chocolate and sugary fruit. with no thought of rejections, mom whips up confections. for blood drives, mom helps to recruit. 
look, i know what i'm talking about, and balloon sleeves are full, and puff out, gathered back at the cuff. see, i've studied this stuff. about fashion i'm rarely in doubt. 
"this airmail's been canceled, defaced," said the dealer with open distaste. "careful folks who collect stamps find ways to protect stamps. let a stamp do its job? that's a waste." 
while prime is the beef world's rolls royce, most market displays feature choice. though you might not reject the less tender select, if it's standard, speak up, raise your voice. 
grab a nap, man, it's not worth the money. you're in line for a stroke?it's not funny. better learn how to stop or you'll blow and just drop. do you think you're the energizer bunny? 
"go west!" i could use a few breaks, so i moved to the coast from the lakes. california's sure nice, but life here has a price? lots of brush fires, mudslides and quakes. 
call her liveable, sexy or quaint, hot and humid's the only complaint. y'all come by, you'll agree: lovely charleston, s. c. lives genteelly, with southern restraint. 
moving here was one stupid mistake? so inhumanly hot, for god's sake, it could saut? your brain. man, i'd murder for rain. in this hellhole, i'm just gonna bake. 
when we write to give history a face, every age has a soul to embrace: use its clothing and food to help capture a mood. it's a day in some quaint time and place. 
what a vision! the poor man was thrown: such perfection, to him, was unknown, and his praise waxed vociferous: "the girl's angeliferous; i'm aiming to make her my own." 
your antipathy still going strong? you have hugged that ambition too long. the dang milk is long spilt; i ain't 'fessin' to guilt, but we're sisters. this business is wrong. 
her doberman often looks vicious? always slavering, snarling: ambitious. she says, "bobo's ok, look, he's desperate to play." playing fetch seems a tad injudicious. 
"your dockage," i said, "is expensive." the owner seemed hurt and defensive: "we're well-lit and patrolled, all our moorings pre-sold, and our service is quite comprehensive." 
"there's no place like home." that's a given to those with a nice place to live in. it's a doctrine espoused by the comfortably housed, and a dream by which others are driven. 
connie's crawling about on all fours, ass expansive as all of outdoors, and so broadly attractive. my fancies grow active. i love when my wife does her chores. 
first, the ass couldn't stay on his feet. now he's airing his paunch in the street. wasted drunk, wasted date, and it's not even late! he's passed out; now my evening's complete. 
you're my daughter's custodian?please, don't invest her estate overseas (europe's bound to collapse). buy her bullion, perhaps. and, as always, provide expertise. 
don't like counting by twelves? don't despair. clocks and calendars? granted, they're there. and in tolkien's works, elvish is partially twelve-ish, but dozenal system's are rare. 
although turkish dominion's decreased, and the ottoman empire's deceased, nations bound to that past make its legacy vast: the crescent holds sway in the east. 
your beau's on the lam now, my dear. now he's out among the willows, i fear. that won't always be true, though; he'll hie home to you? though perhaps he'll just flat disappear. 
her renown, it appeared, was well-founded: she was shrill; every note just rebounded. ethel practicing scales, not god scraping his nails? calliopean conveys how she sounded. 
springfield's growing beyond recognition. we're planning a valley addition. the indian mounds must remain out of bounds. let 'em rest?best not fight superstition. 
in your sculptures, shaped land plays a part; call it earthworks, or land or earth art. fashion woodpiles and mounds, sculpt the ground that surrounds as it moves you?just follow your heart. 
from their shells, chicks will chip themselves loose, then each egg tooth's no longer of use. in two or three weeks, the "teeth" fall from their beaks: one-use gifts from the chicks' mother goose. 
read the eddas, be versed in the norse. for their myths, they're a great basic source. here are tales of creation, the gods of their nation. learn icelandic; they're part of the course. 
see her ankling slow 'cross the floor? there goes someone i'd pay to explore; guys like me can't be choosy. but i'm sluggish and boozy? ain't budged yet. she's walked out the door. 
me and blue have a first-rate rapport, but he can't handle hunts like before. seems he misunderstands even basic commands. old blue's a bit deaf anymore. 
i have mischief to do, things to hide; lavish light and my works would collide. so i always make certain no chink mars my curtain. i thrive where it's dusky inside. 
entertainment's malicious and lewd; what's promoted as art is just crude. these degenerate times even legalize crimes: grab your hash and stroll publicly nude. 
my grandma espouses donations to a few "save the wombat" foundations. but her fundraising trails what's collected for whales; seems cetaceans rule public relations. 
this'll kill me. i'm well past my peak. i've been backing and forthing all week. the wife's belly's expanding; she's growing demanding? gotta shop till her womb springs a leak. 
what a party! a howling success! its environs were trashed, in a mess: clothing swung in the breeze; folks passed out in the trees, all in varying states of undress. 
with life's pressures and meds, for pete's sake, proper treatments are no piece of cake. disarrayed and distraught, you're a chaos of thought, and that busy brain keeps you awake. 
your style is too florid, ornate; not a notion's portrayed for us straight. it's characteristic of prose euphuistic, four centuries cold, out-of-date. 
i've come into my grandpop's estate, and there's tons of great stuff on my plate. no more scrabbling about? gonna wear myself out: eat unwisely, live large, procreate. 
having hitherto followed the plow, self-sufficiency's served us erenow. but, though born to the grange, let us not shun the strange: we can change? when the lord shows us how. 
the champagne-yellow fine coral sand borders palms overarching the strand. with no bills still to pay, troubled past washed away, she'll be eating right out of my hand. 
hunted down and at last brought to bay, the buck flags near the close of the day. this magnificent beast will be trophy and feast. though defiant, he won't walk away. 
assessing this find was a pleasure; the old masters bring joy beyond measure. these fine brushstrokes make clear that you've found a vermeer: a mature work, it's surely a treasure. 
her evening gown stretched to the floor, so all wondered whose pumps the star wore: bruno maglis or choos? perhaps blahnik's chic shoes. stunning threads?but they'd kill to see more. 
we've returned from the chase in dismay: one more damned uncooperative prey. still, our din was appalling: the hound pack, all bawling, announced us from far, far away. 
many settlers' resolve seemed to wane when a barber blew in off the plain. its winds laden with ice made the stubborn think twice and thirst for the sweet summer rain. 
i eschew all established beliefs; i've got stockpiles of grumbles and beefs. never charge me to choose; why need either side lose? i'm commando?not boxers or briefs. 
how you egotize each time you speak of your intellect, genes or physique! but, you back-number bully, ersatz monty woolley, in truth you're a useless antique. 
all our cheddars are justly renowned, and they're comminuted: sold coarsely ground. a few fussbudgets grumble, "good cheese shouldn't crumble." they're banished; we don't fool around. 
you're illogical, loud and abrasive; his argument's sharp and persuasive. you've shown you can't top it, so shut up and drop it. those quibbles are simply evasive. 
paki-bashing's still heard in some pubs, china-bashing in upper-crust clubs. guiltless people, you'll find, are insulted, maligned. it's as cruel as face-to-face snubs. 
it's our cradle of civilization, where our cultures were born, our foundation: the hot fertile crescent, where conflict's incessant for a slice of the world's prime location. 
he left norway, but longed for this dish; now he's failing, his one final wish is the best bismarck herring? his taste is unerring? it's a salt-cured and seasoned small fish. 
a squirrel's chiropodous?see? hand-like paws help him cling to a tree. but his scaling demands overreach human hands, which are all that the lord's given me. 
we've measured it chronogrammatically: the speed record's broken emphatically. this timing device beyond doubt is precise. our design team's carousing ecstatically. 
fame's demanding; why try to deny it? obscurity draws me? i'll try it? simply fade from the scene, find a modest routine, live in cipherdom: humble and quiet. 
my refinishing job is critiqued: "look, the varnish is pitted and streaked, and in some spots, it's missing. it's ruined by cissing. disastrous!" she's more than just piqued. 
the line's cancrine?the same either way. in reverse, it will still have its say. thoughts set down palindromically speak twice, economically? doubled back?notions twice on display. 
our best striker's a sought-after chap? one more game overseas, one more cap. international matches? great stature attaches. all his caps keep our team on the map. 
he asserted each stance and ideal in a lively exhortatory spiel. how he gestured and flailed till at last i prevailed: "c'mon, gramps, keep one hand on the wheel." 
why the hell won't you eat my beef stew? now it's greens, which you chew and you chew. time alone on the range has effected a change. i'm fed up ? you're beginning to moo. 
baconians pooh-poohed the bard: he was common and playwriting's hard. their acceptable source? francis bacon, perforce? left his cipher? a groundless canard. 
i'm downfield; my defender is beat. and then, twisting, i leap off my feet; once the ball's in my hands, there's a roar from the stands. execution: this pass is complete! 
they were still a redoubtable threat till at last, at culloden, they met, and the jacobites fell: bonnie charlie, farewell. have the stuarts returned? uh, not yet. 
jules prepared oven-baked escargot, and his dish of hot snails stole the show. on his counter's a clutter: shallots minced in butter? and garlic! too much? i don't know. 
with their faith deeply-felt and full-fledged, scottish covenanters solemnly pledged: presbyterians all, they would heed the lord's call? unevasively dour, unhedged. 
i was fervent back then, far away: absolutely involved, engag?. how i marched and protested, sat in, got arrested. i won't join a book club today. 
there's that fuzzy-assed zoo escapee, dasypygal, with butt hair for three. he's dropped trou at my pub, mooned the rotary club? i suspect the freak lives in a tree. 
disputatious, eristic old fool! when he's present i can't keep my cool. if god told him, "you're wrong!" he'd keep coming on strong, just as stubborn and dense as a mule. 
when your action's becoming intense, a brief cutaway heightens suspense, keeps them hungry for more. cut to clothes on the floor? a few frames, and your payoff's immense. 
demulcent in words and in tone, he can calm us clear down to the bone. life is always less bleak once we've heard father speak. he assures us we're never alone. 
with dysthymia, bleakness persists. this depression hangs tough; it resists the elixir of time. and the comeback's a climb plagued by dark, deleterious mists. 
a desire path appears in the snow and pedestrian choice runs the show, shows us how folks behave. only then do we pave? place to place, easy come, easy go. 
we retired to our country retreat once the homestead, at last, was complete, by the spring-water branch babbling straight through our ranch. we've worked hard, but these bounties are sweet. 
once a long-practiced masonry trick: much timber's worked into the brick. thus, by bond timbers strengthened, a wall might be lengthened. these timbers were hewn rather thick. 
this channel runs chilly and bold, but i've promises yet to uphold. i'll be first in her bed if i swim it, she said. keep it warm, doll; at "bed" i was sold. 
this binder leaf smells like old leather; it's gone stale in our stretch of dry weather. great cigars are an art. binders hug a smoke's heart: it's caressed, not just trussed up together. 
i don't treat our relationship lightly, nor loaf about looking unsightly. i've kept friends at arm's length, 'cause i'm saving my strength, and i channel my energies nightly. 
we're as ethnically mixed as can be here on avenues a, b and d: good old alphabet city, new york. yes, we're gritty? never boring, though, take it from me. 
archeosophy welds intuition to the study of ancient cognition. this ethereal science promotes an alliance of logic with faded tradition. 
coming out's a huge social event. it's big doings (live band and a tent). there are shifting tableaux of young belles and their beaux, unconcerned with how much has been spent. 
wow, yesterday's storm was a blinger, a once-in-a-lifetime humdinger. myself and my lover were caught without cover. we're cool, but we've been through a wringer. 
i don't buy all that crap, "less is more"; rubenesque broads are what i adore. like some bedroom mahout, i love poking about. pillowed pulchritude's great to explore. 
a top cat skinner knows his machine, tread to tread, and the guts in between. ever drawn to his 'dozer, like a sweetheart, he knows her. their bladework's so smooth it's obscene. 
living loose, no excuse, running wild, you're too bronco to be with my child. i'll admit it's alarming she finds you so charming, but she's young, overwhelmed and beguiled. 
some traditions i wouldn't oppose; i'd be breeding a scab on my nose. there are those who might balk at such mutinous talk. i dissent, but i'm loath to disclose. 
the dastardly villain's portrayed wildly wielding his excurvate blade, its edge cleaving the air. but the good guy won't scare? he's not there to be diced and filleted. 
this bunkhouse is just for us men. it's our boar's nest, so scat, you fool hen! no one here needs no strife with the bossman's son's wife? better lonesome than time in the pen. 
not an egg since? well, i don't know when: she's a boarder, that empty old hen: purely peckin' and poop, wasted space in the coop. let's have soup; she'll be useful again. 
anastomotically joining its courses, smaller rivulets share a stream's forces, divide waters about, and a delta spreads out ? quite a journey from where that stream's source is. 
school is out, so let's throw us a bash. i can brace uncle buck for the cash. though old buck's no soft touch, i won't ask him for much? just remind him he flashed me his stash. 
it's an evening of opera?my choice, for productions, but, oh, for the voice. the libretto?the book? rarely grabs me. my hook is the music. in that i rejoice. 
listen closely, a bug in your ear? some advice that could save your career: the director despises unwelcome surprises. it's suicide; don't interfere. 
there's a bug up his ass about fries: all the best ones he'd criminalize. while he's rich and persistent, i'm perverse and resistant. "those potatoes?" i say: "jumbo-size!" 
he's one helluva bucker, that lennie, and while simpler than most other men, he has quite enough brain to load great sacks of grain, and he'll tell you his dreams for a penny. 
crashing through collyer mansion conditions, amid all sorts of noxious emissions, the firefighters grumbled, searched blindly and stumbled on tons of long-saved acquisitions. 
scotland's brutal, enforced highland clearances led to cultural loss, disappearances: humans ousted for sheep (still, the landlords could sleep). for the poor, life's about perseverances. 
our new baritenor's singing tonight in otello; his range is just right, with a little of each, plus bravura and reach. he's the company's  new leading light. 
it's breezed up; there's a storm heading in. don't go far, you'll get drenched to your skin. when the shutters are banging and drainpipes start clanging, a nor'easter's about to begin. 
with my fishing gear right in the car loads of angletwitches filling a jar, i'll be off for some angling from a bank, my hook dangling fresh worms?a whole jarful goes far. 
from that pulpit appointed for prayer, compassionless words chill the air: not the least understanding, but cold and demanding. he's a merciless, smug doctrinaire. 
i was hauling a dangerous load when a dust devil hit, so i slowed. had to focus my mind: i'd been stricken half blind by an eyeful of dust from the road. 
there's a cellar, if anyone cares: outside doors, then a short flight of stairs. once that bulkhead's unlocked and supplies are restocked, you'll be set to run catered affairs. 
as we'd planned, life was grand?simply splendid. but we've slipped, clearly whipped?it's all ended. it's quits; we're dead certain. we'll move on, draw the curtain, neither harboring doubt nor offended. 
my old pick-up's been beaten and battered, with both backup lights thoroughly shattered. in reverse, i still warn when i lean on my horn, and just now, seven nuns simply scattered. 
our old bullwhacker's out on the road with the oxen, transporting a load. they may never get back by that old, rutted track: while he slept, it iced up. now it's snowed. 
a new age balneologist, she gets my aura aligned with my qi. but massage in my bath can arouse?do the math. happy endings may come with the fee. 
some think alleys mean garbage and fleas, but in parks, they have bushes and trees. spend delectable days in these flower-lined ways, amid birdsong and soft, fragrant breeze. 
my model's a small ?corch? that shows muscles?no skin's in the way. it's a flayed human torso, stripped naked and more so, but my sculpture's skinned over with clay. 
i'm aware it's the mine. i don't care: goddamned coal powder's filling the air. i've endured it too long; breathing bug dust's just wrong. and i hate what it does to my hair. 
they're too careful. they're telling us zip, so i'm sure there's a bug under the chip. there's some headache to hide: the deal's dark, dirty side. look, they're sweating; i'll bet it's a pip. 
yellow bug lights glow, yard after yard, so our evenings are less often marred. we relax on a lawn to which pests aren't drawn, and returning indoors becomes hard. 
some leachings in streambeds down here would suggest a blind lode should be near. but before i start digging, i'll need dozers and rigging, on credit, i hope, from john deere. 
she spoke eloquently, clear and compelling, so the mob simmered down and stopped yelling. most relaxed, even smiled, now entranced and beguiled? defused, and no longer rebelling. 
smell this milk; i've a cold, but i think this container's beginning to blink. no, it's not overpowering, but check if it's souring. don't wait till the fridge starts to stink. 
without straight parts or angles, you'll see: a curve's easy, point a to point d. it's a walk in the park? just a line like an arc. what's the problem? how tough could that be? 
it appears, uncorrupted, ideal: his eidolon, sans lifeblood, so real. it's abstraction, that's true, but a manifest clue to what mutable solids conceal. 
smuggle diamonds? pays well?i might risk it. i could re-do my bun as a biscuit. and why would that matter? it's smaller and flatter. at check-in, they likely won't frisk it. 
they'd resisted spiked plates on their soles till the falls filled their doubts full of holes. so the loggers all talked; now their boots are all calked (not the best, though, for amorous strolls). 
at design sessions known as charettes, ideas fly; it's as free as it gets. here all parties involved may have issues resolved. pressure's on, but with minimal threats. 
now the honor was his, as his right: pure of heart, he'd be belted in white. so he knelt by the queen in this time-honoured scene, and arose newly dubbed "belted knight." 
the question's at last been resolved: the coelacanth's barely evolved? almost nil, bradytelic? a true living relic. but it lives?one more mystery solved. 
i can't translate those words, sir, i'm sorry. these peons are speaking bihari. and there's no easy fix; they're provincials ? just hicks ? but i'm fluent in urdu and dari. 
hang propriety! mammon's their creed: as ye covet, so shall ye succeed. their monstrous capacity serves their voracity. meet the chuzzlewits, champions of greed. 
her furnishings? surely a hoot: room to room, motifs don't follow suit, like that odd directoire (neoclassic) boudoir with its touch of old egypt to boot. 
at thirty, boz travels the states. he would see what delight there awaits. then american notes grabs his hosts by their throats, and twists. such acerbity grates. 
i'm unused to this stretch, but i'm learning about parts where the river is turning: shorelines steepen each day, undercut, worn away. at these cut banks, the water is churning. 
as cablecasters, what's our concern? provide shows for a solid return. we fill ever more niches, and in flow the riches. as we show, so, we've found, shall we earn. 
much ado at the office today: i got called on my lateness, they say. (i myself missed the fuss, fast asleep on the bus while some blabbermouth gave me away.) 
his dean martin celebrity roast: every guest tried to trash him the most. hearing gibe after gibe from the rest of his tribe, he sat smiling?and planned his riposte. 
a better mousetrap is always in order, like our new paper-thin voice recorder: a delightful device, and we're cutting our price. our production's just moved 'cross the border. 
shirley's showing?no lies or pretense. garden's planted?you'd best build the fence: tie the knot and quit hiding; it's done, no deciding. settle down. it's just plain common sense. 
"change the baby," she called from the door. he's my boy, so i've managed before. i inspected his nappy: as expected, right crappy. she's come home: "he's just done a bit more." 
secure viands or yield to starvation. in each creature lurk seeds of mutation. joy devolves to divorce. every race runs its course. eval statements: all speak of duration. 
time to end what your mischief began; you'll be in for a call-down, my man. once your pa sees this mess, you'd best up and confess. (i'll be gone when the shit hits the fan.) 
here's a caution for you: he's no sheep. try to fleece him, it's you who will weep. and forget getting cute; you won't con the old coot, 'cause you can't catch a weasel asleep. 
he had glared so, i feared he might hit me. how expansive of him to admit me! he'd turned warm and informal; i thought, "he's not normal." then i offered my hand? and he bit me! 
our home's a converted old mill nestled into the slope of a hill. the interior's changed: gussied up, rearranged, but our ivied old walls?dressed to kill. 
simple shoe bomb?i'd made it from scratch; simple fuse?it would burn with dispatch; i attempted to light it, but failed to ignite it: i struck, but the match wouldn't catch. 
there's a mare to be serviced today? in the air, a provoking bouquet, so the colt's more than frisky. don't approach him; it's risky. when he's cadgy, we keep folks away. 
braggadocious? of course, he's my son, and a truly remarkable one: though a mere twenty-eight, he can list every state? where're you going? i've barely begun. 
he'd worked hard, always brought home the bacon till the night we discovered the break-in. he won't eat since that theft. only buzzard bait's left? skin and bones. he was that badly shaken. 
that's a beegum, where honeybees swarm: hollow tree trunks are best in a storm. in high season, the hive is abuzz and alive. they arrive, clear the decks and perform. 
what awaits them each day? bedbug row, where 'most nothing seems clean but fresh snow, where all water runs cold, where you grow too soon old. a hardscrabble world's all they know. 
matthew arnold thought culture supreme? education's support his life's theme. his charge: read analytically, questioning critically; perfection is more than a dream. 
i've been schooled, sir, and well know my duty. i beg leave to beau betty, your beauty. get a lady home whole is a gentleman's role. but i'll need self-control. she's a cutie. 
before long, early snows will appear, so the season of beefing is here: poorer grazing, froze water? time to sell them to slaughter. raising steers is a hard-nosed career. 
poor penelope! all the kids tease her. it's those wide, hairy holes on her beezer. called "cave snout," "miss furry," she decamps in a hurry to weep softly where nobody sees her. 
hubby's working three jobs for you, honey? to provide you with  oodles of money? the guy loves you that much? doesn't that beat the dutch? dump the dork; now i'm sure something's funny. 
on a fortunate night, i give thanks for the spuds buried loosely in banks. then i burrow to "borrow" my meals for tomorrow, to fatten my flea-ridden flanks. 
we've had biblical rain?it's torrential, and the high-water rise? exponential. take emergency measures: grab totable treasures. evacuation at once is essential. 
you shrug, "just a pimple." get real! that abscess has started to beal. you're too cool and collected. your neck is infected! that gross-out has ruined my meal. 
wrought iron's functional, jack, and no fooling; it's our baker's rack, mainly for cooling: there's a load of fresh pies and warm bread, some supplies. get a hold of yourself. jack, you're drooling. 
if they backlight my hair, it will glow, like a knoll with a dusting of snow. to the photo's beholder, i'll look rather older? an effect i'd prefer to forgo. 
we're in trouble, and guess what to thank: the economy's gone in the tank. we'll abandon construction, due to funding reduction. our project's now owned by some bank. 
we're not rich here, but holding our own. wish the mayor would leave us alone: promised jobs, renovations come with loss, confiscations once we're labeled an enterprise zone. 
if we balance, we'll pass with facility, though this stretch isn't known for tranquility. wipe that fear from your face. help us out, throw a brace: use your paddle to give us stability. 
yankee blue bellies, pack up and git! northern manners and cussin' ain't fit. y'all run off at the mouth after scorchin' the south. we'll surrender, but never submit! 
i'll bear off, so i don't scrape that boulder. current's strong, so i'll brace with my shoulder? it worked, as expected, but still, i'm dejected: my aches say i am getting older. 
"keep your paws off that chuck box, you swine!" roared the cook at the front of the line. he'd just gotten a shipment of kitchen equipment. "the box and what's in it are mine." 
careful probing uncovers what's true as the sunshine evaporates dew. therefore, lie, if you will: it may serve you, until what is genuine slowly shows through. 
no more airlines? we used to have three. without service, this town's up a tree. but their only concern's their diminished returns? it's abandonment, plain as can be. 
cleveland amory managed affairs by assuming curmudgeonly airs. while he published dim views of the arts and the news, he'd an animal advocate's cares. 
first reaping's been carted away. nothing's left for a roll in the hay, but i'm not feeling blue, 'cause an aftercrop's due? one more chance to lead leila astray. 
i insulted my barber one day, and soon had the devil to pay. the man butchered my hair; that's a rug, now, up there. i call it my "devil toupee." 
best be watchful: she's crashing from speed. she's lethargic?with her, guaranteed: she'll be coming down hard, darkly moody and scarred, still enslaved by her one desperate need. 
i keep seeing your cinnamon hair: sunset auburn?a color so rare. in the ghost light of dawn, you're beside me; i'm drawn, but too quickly, you melt in the air. 
sell your properties fast: save your skin! brickor mortis has clearly set in. all the agents keep trying, but no one is buying. some fat cats are stylishly thin. 
common shoppers assume they're debris: scrip or coin-like, some once came for free. "little billboards," they're named (i've my finest ones framed). exonumia fascinate me. 
is a driver dog-tired, overweight? we're his back-ups, we all can relate. maybe dozens of trucks lined up nicely, like ducks? we're a convoy at work, hauling freight. 
i'd greatly admire to know why she eludes me; what does that imply? does my wooing technique arouse nothing but pique? just a smile, and i'd curl up and die. 
constant boozing earns nothing but scorn; you were drunk, dad, the day i was born. there'll be time for contrition, but first your admission: it's time to acknowledge the corn. 
"calm down," my wife whispered emphatically. "get a grip; you're behaving erratically: unpredictably loopy, on a cloud, then dead droopy." she then kissed me and stormed out dramatically. 
it's a dress, no armani creation: an ephemeral empty sensation. but, designed for that rich, little talentless bitch, it's already inspired imitation. 
it's from elsewhere, this boulder of gneiss? from the catskills, to be more precise. though it's presently static, this glacial erratic once cruised on a great sheet of ice. 
please excuse me?may i interject? is this woman you hope to elect one we'll come to admire, who'll stand firm under fire? our choice must exact great respect. 
stop asserting it's too much to ask, 'cause i'm equal, i'm sure, to the task. let's begin; ring the bell. i'm as thirsty as hell. fifteen minutes? i'll down the whole cask. 
with each episode, ella's aggression succumbs less and less to suppression. each occasion makes clearer that day's drawing nearer? we'll call for some skilled intercession.

strolling easy where pinecones abound, our emotions unvoiced but profound, we're away from the crowd, walking light on a cloud, where diddledees carpet the ground. 
spiteful claggart's death also killed hope: budd was tongue-tied?too flawless to cope. faced with evil, words failed him; claggart smiled when budd nailed him, leaving vere with no choice but the rope. 
no more fire, no glamour, no glow: we were done, and i knew i should go. so i gave her my yacht, and a generous pot. she was stunned, but it cushioned the blow. 
arching upward, the gateway's embowed. it acclaims the old pioneer road. a burgeoning nation passed the future location of this vaulted steel span, this great ode. 
from the andes to falklands, behold: the diddle-dee takes on the cold. on stone slopes and flats, it forms low-growing mats. ornamental? by some it's extolled. 
our exiguous share of the crop didn't bring very much at the shop: a rough tick for our bed, needed dry goods and thread, and for timmy, a store-bought'n top. 
because overhead costs are immense for  a trucker, it's plain common sense: a return bonus load, just one more, for the road. a good backhaul defrays the expense. 
peel it off, press it on. it can't hurt. keep in mind, though, it's tough to revert. ecologically "green"? no, but easy to clean: contact paper protects things from dirt. 
even basics escaped him at school. now he can't bell a buzzard, the fool. yet he's fathered a brood, so i'd have to conclude that he's found the right slot for his tool. 
"this law's constitutionally sound," said the president, standing his ground. if the court disagrees, he'll be down on his knees begging congress to help him rebound. 
the cute bottlenose (butt-'em-nosed) dolphin: his play can be rougher than rolfin'. harbor porpoises? toast ? flipped from pillar to post. but who knows? could be dolphin-style golfin'. 
i set off to buy dry goods in town, but the merchant adjudged me a clown (i was wet and bedraggled). we're poor, so i haggled, and stubbornly bantered him down. 
though the asking price keeps on ascending, the search for our love nest is ending: a colonial mansion with room for expansion. a major expenditure's pending. 
kid behind me keeps smacking her lips, and in front, they're all champing on chips. at a flick, ask for quiet? i wouldn't dare try it. damn the teen talk and loud, vapid quips. 
told my faithful old gardener, zed, "angel's trumpets would brighten that bed." i envisioned a bower of the pink, cone-shaped flower. sweet bawds grace my chambers in stead. 
what a workout! i really should shower, but i'm late?been "at lunch" for an hour. it's a cat bath for me: soap and rinse, one-two-three, some cologne and i'll smell like a flower. 
there's a chance we can still right this ship, but let's face it, your weeping means zip. we're not here to test tissue, so don't cloud the issue. face it squarely. good lord, get a grip!. 
"damaged goods," people say, "not all there, she's endured way too much wear and tear? first one creep, and then others, her old man, then her brothers? deeply wounded and lost in despair." 
renovations meant toting out trash. now my yard sports a big, nasty brash. oh, the names i've been called! could have junked it, but stalled. want it gone, folks? then cough up some cash. 
it's near christmas?a few days before. ragged belsnickel stops at your door. do you dare ask him in? well, how good have you been? well-behaved? you'll have presents galore. 
a cadogan's an odd sort of teapot: upside-downish, with no lid we see pot. i once learned from the telly it's filled through its belly, this petite, two for tea, rather wee pot. 
granny's ackempucky's never been bland. it's prepared with whatever's to hand and delectable spices. the aroma entices. each creation's unique and unplanned. 
i'm an everyday book-buying chap, taken in by co-edited crap: great, dull tomes that sustain every bookstore and chain. where there's style, it's all over the map. 
if we smarten this flat, do our "dance," then this cosmetized deal stands a chance. so it's falling apart? with some paint and wall art, we'll sign them and get their advance. 
a bullbat eats insects that fly; like a namesake, it sups while on high. though a nighthawk's no bat (or a bull, come to that), it booms as it zooms through the sky. 
certain hosts one should not underrate. ever see william buckley debate? he'd be warm and polite? and eternally right? only victims stepped up to that plate. 
this script's clever, but lacks believability. it's rank nonsense that cells harm fertility. then some entrepreneur doles them out to the poor? hell, it's congress that fosters sterility. 
my alerter's a sort of alarm engineered to keep train crews from harm: if i'm not at the stick, it will throttle down quick. if it fails, though, we're buying the farm. 
get some wall anchors, then we'll proceed: hanging shelving, choose strength over speed. an expansion bolt's grip is unlikely to slip. maybe twenty?that's all we should need.

"your engine block's cracked; she's a goner? i swear," he said, "grease monkey's honor. she won't run now, she's scrap. (man, these yugos were crap.) what a heap!
"rub on elemi oil for complexion or steam it for chest-based infection." just a tad oversold? hype it right and it's gold. there's no resin consumer protection. 
building here was an awful mistake; blind mosquitoes won't cut us a break. there are shore-to-shore clouds of these chizzywinks?crowds of white midges that blanket the lake. 
an achievement holds more than one's shield. our particulars here are revealed, for the helm shows our rank, these beasts, whom we thank ? you may guess why the sea forms our field. 
though i know he's earned cottage decrees, he's developed old-timer's disease. those are eggcorns at work, meant to fetch forth a smirk? misconstructions. now, cut to the cheese. 
tucson's searing the soles of my feet, so, near noon, i head in off the street. in the shade's where i'll linger, not moving a finger? a conditioned response to the heat. 
tiny chitterdiddles chirping all night spread their gossip with cheerful delight. summerlong they reveal: katy did it? for real! katy did! and we doubt she's contrite. 
sarge was stewing. here's how we could tell: gone his swagger, his chevron as well. it was pulled from his sleeve ? sort of absent on leave ? replaced by a slim chevronel.

i'll truck home in a convoy with flair, in the center, the old easy chair, nice and safe, unexposed, 'cause our backdoor is closed. biggest threat's from a bear in the air.

caught flat-footed, stuck for an answer, i've been beckoned then kissed by "my" dancer. sure, i've watched her all night in the club's lambent light. now i'm stunned by the chance to romance her.

as, alarmingly, peer gynt advanced, en arri?re?moving rearward?she danced. she drew quickly away with a graceful chass?. her pursuer stood rooted?entranced. 
no matter whose gardens they roam, when my honeybees buzz from their home, they will not go astray. something shows them the way unerringly home to their comb. 
the marsupial dibbler is found, if at all, amidst leaves on the ground, but he sleeps when it's light, and emerges at night to seek dinner by scrounging around. 
in intense purple plush, he was draped; 'gainst the tempests and rains he was caped. once he strode into view in this rich, royal hue, people froze, struck a pose or just gaped. 
here's a job that provides you autonomy (ivory towerish, much like astronomy), biochemical science, but with narrow appliance: the profession of chemotaxonomy. 
"those embattled guys must have been nude. dad, is that why he called this bridge rude?" "no, damn sure they were right ? they were ready to fight. and the bridge? well, it's roughly built, crude." 
conditions affect vegetation: ups and downs through the years?annuation. when you've got things together: six months of dry weather. (farm success goes beyond cultivation.) 
i've employed conjurations and potions in my efforts to stir her emotions. but she's not apathetic, just deeply ascetic. who am i to deny her devotions? 
ceilings painted di sotto in s? may deceive with a 3d-like view. their foreshortened perspective is very effective: no ceiling?we're gazing right through.

our cedar's gone brash, it's so dry. summer heat's turned it brittle; that's why. this old wood's bound to splinter, and won't last the winter. fresh cherry is growing nearby. 
confronted with stone formed from mud, a diluvialist might blame a flood: "this terrain underwent an extensive event." to most others, the theory's a dud. 
saying "hell" was, to grandpa, taboo; "go to ballyhack" always would do. we who'd roused the old gent knew at once what he meant and, respectfully, meekly, withdrew. 
i've mishandled my store's stock of bries? ever smell an ammoniated cheese? that stale urine-like stink caused my nostrils to shrink. i'll bone up on my cheese expertise. 
by the ruins of ancient cyrene, in libya, lynn tried linguini. "sic transit?," she thought, "once on top, come to nought." then she ordered another martini.

one more lodgepole stacked up in a deck? men at work keeping nature in check. lumber fresh from the felling is not as compelling. see it all without craning your neck. 
drowsy days at your desk?what a deal! better stir or your blood might congeal. get to work and collapse into salaried naps. you chairwarmers legally steal. 
an analphabet knocked at my door seeking tutelage?hard to ignore. every day she returned, and in no time she'd learned how to read?now it's books by the score. 
your kitchen's a mess?better clean it; it's as filthy as ever i've seen it: my inspection's just found bits of bread all around. when i call something crumby, i mean it.

our great leader's not known for his tact; when he speaks ex cathedra, we act. when that office proposes, no sane soldier dozes: all rush to turn concept to fact. 
certain therapies draw patients out, and for demons go questing about? for results abreactive, hard-won and attractive? cathartic, they feel, beyond doubt. 
how delicious to watch the au pair dust the knickknacks on that etagere. as she reaches and bends, clothing dips and ascends, but i'm stuck in this chair? c'est la guerre!

their brochure came; the pitch promised pleasure: "we'll regale you with joys beyond measure." such sumptuous vices, such exorbitant prices? that spa was commodified leisure. 
here's our color choice?very extensive, and our card stock you won't find expensive. great for bright, sturdy menus for food service venues and posters. we're quite comprehensive. 
between sourdough crusts, like a pie, golden pastry cream beckons the eye (or a jam of fresh cherry or your favorite berry). it's basque cake for christmas ? stop by. 
in the doorway he'd lean on his broom, his bay window occluding the room. that commodious gut, like a belt-girdled hut, blocked the sunlight?the torso of doom. 
anthroponymy studies folks' names: "far too ethnic," one father exclaims? "that's old-fashioned; too cute; ugh, they'll think he's a fruit." choosing good names is not fun and games. 
if you deal with that chap, have a care; he's got by-ends in mind he won't share. i don't say he's a crook, but before you leap, look. it's too late when you learn in mid-air. 
at my desk, i just get borrowed light from the corridor?distant and slight. i've been moved from my window; guess somehow i've sinned?oh, permit me to prove i'm contrite. 
the sporades, early july: the etesians rose, steady and dry, blowing straight from the north. it was time to set forth, and bid kos a reluctant goodbye. 
it's a struggle to stroll up the street in this rarefied rockies retreat. public rest rooms and banks feature oxygen tanks. elevation here's twelve thousand feet. 
blackened catfish for dinner?again? a bit bland today; pass the cayenne. cajun's always in vogue on this dark-water bogue: this sweet stream known as bayou duchenne. 
it's unusually chilly today: dogwood winter. still, spring's here to stay. disconcerting, i know? there's a dusting of snow. doesn't god know it's three weeks till may?

summer sun turns my yearnings impure: all that splendid, half-naked allure. sure, the snuggling's been sweet in our winter retreat, but the estival pleasures endure.

let's tell sadie, "go tend to the brute." when she blushes, i find it real cute. he's a "male-cow" to sadie, who's ever the lady. her propriety's always a hoot. 
crowns of sonnets i've laid out before her, yet she doesn't suspect i adore her. each byway she frequents has a poetry sequence, as do rooms where i long to explore her.

an egestuous gent is young cuddy, ever desperate for funds from a buddy, who, though loath to indict, still might gently invite him to toil. is he likely? not bloody. 
more canvas! we must have more sail! grab this wind and i swear we can't fail. see the genoa fill? always gives me a thrill. if we hold thirty knots, we prevail. 
from the hollers, from small private stills comes the finest blockade in these hills. nothing knocks you flat quicker than our local corn liquor, sold in mason jars only?no frills. 
if it's feathered, i find it bewitching; avicultural facts are enriching. i dig everything bird, from the tongue to the turd. sure i raise them. they sing when they're bitching. 
babes are nubile, half-dressed and they're free, and the beer comes in barrels; you'll see. sure, it's costly, but wait: dad and state pay the freight. campus living's the lifestyle for me.

women fear, now, to go for a stroll where this eve-teasing's out of control. all you motherless slobs, merely cowards in mobs, are disgusting! crawl back in your hole. 
his intentions, far less than polite, left her battered and bruised from the fight. he dismissed her plight breezily: "you damage too easily. just relax or you'll ruin my night." 
the huge rig makes a horrible sound as it corkscrews down deep in the ground. are they digging a well or a hallway to hell? maybe neither, just screwing around. 
once onstage, she would gesture and pout, demonstratively moving about. with all eyes drawn to her, something odd would occur: she'd go still, then turn pale and black out. 
"decontrol!" was the picketers' cry, as each media anchor swung by. "about time inner cities could spend their schools' kitties ? the community's piece of the pie."

fifty miles, that's about eighty clicks? we'd hiked eighty hot clicks through the sticks. what the hell could we say? the old man led the way. he's the terror and pride of fort dix. 
he's built angularly?jagged and skewed, lots of knobs where stuff shouldn't protrude. and the bones of his face are all over the place. when he made him, god must have been stewed. 
our old causeway will have to be junked; it's battered and sundered and chunked. someone started a ferry? successful? not very. as a matter of fact, it's defunct. 
the law's sponsors are sweating it out, 'cause its constitutionality's in doubt. it's too late for a deal once the court's forced repeal. next election may turn to a rout.

today's youngsters do not comprehend that with pennies, we'd plenty to spend. we would lick, suck or chew for a brownie or two, and have extra to share with a friend. 
my top candids you'd likely discard. i just love to catch subjects off-guard. i've been spurned and attacked for these photos. in fact, at my family thanksgivings, i'm barred. 
he's a gross-out, disgusting?the pits, and he's all over pustules and zits, with a stench-field of feet. i'll be changing my seat to as far as this classroom permits.

men, get moving; the troop's reassigned: the colonel's again changed his mind. skivvies packed, double-quick, 'cause we march in a tick. unit equipage follows behind. 
our dog doggerel's not very big. she's pink-snouted and squeals like a pig. so a canine biologist, a famous cynologist, keeps stalking her, watching her dig. 
you've got chilblains and warts on your toes; all that's painful enough,  i suppose. your long marriage just ended, credit's overextended. barking dogs are the least of your woes. 
a forestry cruiser's well paid as he seeks the top vertical grade. old growth standing tall? his sharp eye makes the call. giants fall; he moves on, undismayed. 
the big chill limned a whole generation: grown-up boomers, their angst and stagnation. what they've sought has been handed them; here's where it's landed them. kasdan's story eludes explication. 
this great room's a true cabinet of wonders, of god's triumphs, perhaps, and his blunders. here are portraits and rings and strange skeletal things, all on view at the home of its funders. 
anecdotals, not merely statistics, are the data of ethnolinguistics. group drives and possessions create some expressions defining rough characteristics. 
epiclimates take up little space. they're as small as a leaf's upper face, tiny gaps in leaf litter, or the skin of a critter. mingle climates with me; let's embrace. 
careful measurement's always my rule. this geologist's favorite tool hits the nail on the head: strike and dip of a bed? brunton compass?compact and way cool.

dressed in blue jeans, a boy can't go wrong, 'cause they're washable, popular, strong. if they drag in the dust, fold 'em up?readjust: you can cuff 'em when legs are too long. 
the grazing's well-nigh given out? cattle carcasses scattered about. fourteen months since it's rained; our capacity's strained. this die-up is caused by the drought. 
with our revenue spent in a flash, we then borrowed a mountain of cash. the state watchdogs were dozing; huge banks started closing. many concauses led to this crash. 
my envelope table's quite clever. have i wanted one? man, have i ever! the effect it achieves with triangular leaves? as my bridge partner said, "well, i never!" 
our ligaments link us, although under stress, they'll fatigue and let go. with the art of desmology and today's  kinesiology, we're learning to soften the blow. 
by the chesapeake, crabbing is king. i've found chicken neck bait's just the thing. soft-shell blue crab's the best: it's already undressed. a full crab pot: the bounty of spring. 
college grandstands can get like a zoo. crowds are restless, need something to do. massive card stunts are neat? keep each fan by a seat. tv cameras just eat them up too. 
life was hardscrabble, rough at the seams, but exceptions encouraged their dreams, and they kept finding flecks: gold in granules or specks. there was color in most of the streams. 
a wage is commodification, argue marxists, with much animation. can one place a true worth on the salt of the earth and account for each sweet variation? 
he was trained in the indies, correct? still, a leader in every respect. though his english is flawed, his cadetship abroad nurtured talents we all can detect. 
that's a challenger, jack's brand new toy, because jack's a great big little boy. "man, this dodge really kicks," he says, "look, a v-6!" with his cars, jack is not a dull boy.

she crippled across to me, pleading: "i'm broke, and my babies want feeding. sure, it's shameful to beg, but disease bent my leg. sir, i merely request what i'm needing." 
dim lamplight?she simply looks faded, yet she's damaged, distressed and degraded. add a crosslight; her face shows the mark of disgrace. "that's a print!" the director's persuaded.

straight vodka's my antifogmatic; i'm so high now, i'm nearly ecstatic. morning's misty and damp? i may still get a cramp, but my moans won't be too operatic. 
at the rail, my habitual space, i'm methodically doping each race. that surprise belmont victor? the long shot? i picked her, but had her to place? just in case. 
in an old part of town, there's a shop that's called harvester's doohickey crop. they've a widget: you name it, it's yours; you can claim it. need a thingamajig? it's your stop. 
he was gone when his home town was sacked, but we're lucky: his hideout's intact. with official permission, we'll search the position. we await your enabling act.

as a grassland ecologist learns, behind flames, nature's bounty returns. plants like creosote gone, denser forage lives on. through confinement, we manage our burns. 
the more money i've got for my brood the smaller the part used for food. thus states ernst engel's law. but i'm hardly in awe, 'cause it took little thought to conclude. 
the ad for these boots is a laugh. they're unyielding, too lifeless by half. so whatever their claim, the couturier's name can't convince me the leather is calf.

i've a constant companion in bed; she's a bottle of sweet dago red, 'cause it's syrupy, cheap, and it puts me to sleep. still i long for a woman instead. 
they criss-crossed north african sand and pursued erwin rommel's command. the great desert rats corps of the second world war garnered fame in the few years it spanned. 
an old prospector, luke never quit, but kept scraping the sands. he had grit. with his desert rat ways, lucius lived out his days, rarely speaking: "a waste of good spit." 
in the background of bonnie and clyde plays the "breakdown," a wild banjo ride. 'cause a breakdown's a hoedown, those pickers don't slow down? dance and drink without breaking your stride.

"welcum, genmin," he said, with a drawl, "y'all needs no interduckshun at awl." then, as though to confide, the man gestured inside. "an' there's wimmin enuff; have a bawl." 
i'm in trouble: my faceprint's on file; plastic surgery's surely worthwhile. it's not safe for a thug with my elegant mug. time to alter this glorious smile. 
time to beef our old milk cow at last. she produced, but those days are long past. now, with dairy days through, she'll be pound steak and stew. life's a struggle; don't stand there aghast. 
family photo: my greek uncle bert, as an evzone in tights and white skirt. it reads, "bert, in the army." no way! that's just barmy. check this out, bro?you'll laugh till you hurt.

uncle gustav talked nature with ease, like the latinate labels for trees: "that's a beech," he'd say, "fagus." "sure, whatever you say, gus. let's move on to the birds and the bees." 
familiarity may "breed contempt," but from that dictum, dear, you're exempt. in fact, it's alarming: each day, you're more charming. for balance, let's both get unkempt.

an estate car's thought dull, as a rule, yet i own one. i'm nobody's fool: the decision was tactical; girls think i'm practical, and the tailgate's seductively cool. 
it's exhausting to try to get slim; i feel fagged from my time at the gym. it's been worth it, no doubt, all that hard working out. she's decided to make me her "him." 
we're beguiled as she walks through the hall, a grand entrance all there will recall: nonchalant and sedate, and just fashionably late. we're grateful she's shown up at all. 
we've refigured your income tax rates due to falsification of dates: one dependent's at least twenty-two years deceased. for two decades you've tempted the fates.

your dyspathy's shown by your acts, such as visceral wanton attacks. your ingrained disposition to resistance, suspicion? one day, you'll be shot in your tracks. 
i'll edge closer; this broad takes the cake. the snow crumps with each damned step i take. crunching keeps me away from the tempting display: winter peeping?i can't catch a break! 
propagation by cuttage retains the good traits of developing strains. one plant's bearing more beans? then treasure its genes: take cuttings, implant them?take pains. 
your philosophy's pallid and weak, self-impressed and obsessed with technique? no conviction, no muscle, it's so? bertrand russell. its etiolated voice is a squeak. 
robert's assay's arrived, and he's crowing: his claim's where there's blossom rock showing. that oxide-stained quartz very clearly supports bob's faith that his future is glowing. 
does his son have a lot on the ball 'cause he's swimming, though not two feet tall? i remain unimpressed: he knows one stroke, at best. almost all kids his age do the crawl. 
something's dined on these oysters before us? perhaps several: a virtual chorus. once these drills pierce a shell, they reward themselves well. the result: every bivalve here's porous. 
in their struggles, great heracles found that antaeus drew strength from the ground. when lifted aloft, huge antaeus grew soft. the conclusions some draw are profound. 
breakfast eggs, sir?you ordered ahead: alabama style, just like you said. fresh whole wheat, lightly fried, the eggs nestled inside, in a hollow cut out of the bread. 
there she stood, on the drop edge of yonder, the elysian fields soon to wander, her soul glory-borne. she'd be gone before morn. 'tis a sobering moment to ponder. 
son, i've read it. i'm still at a loss; your allusions don't quite come across 'cause you're trying too hard. it's a father's day card so darn cryptic it begs for a gloss. 
in each facial canal in my head, there's no shipping; a nerve's there instead (in each temporal bone as a doc would have known). now, please leave them alone? till i'm dead. 
it was squally and damp, with a chill, then the blood rain?the wheat fields grew still. some blamed dust off the prairie, but i swear it was scary? a summoning straight from boot hill. 
gen'ral jackson still rides, locals say, and, still dashing, no hint of decay, cries "forever my valley," then "hang my finale!" old soldiers don't all fade away. 
took a blast from my truck's deluge gun? this fool firefighter's concept of fun. man, did i take a fall! it could knock down a wall. that's the dumbest thing i've ever done. 
sure, i called you a butt-head; it's true. it's genetic, so what can you do? try to sprout horns forever: a futile endeavor? but you'll shine in my famous veal stew. 
she'll bogue leeward in autumn's light breeze and ship water in moderate seas. someone went a bit far when he said she was "yare": she demands an old tar's expertise. 
they're so trendily, faddishly dressed, a la gentleman's quarterly?blest? looking stylish and lean, metrosexuals preen, by those men in the mirror impressed. 
as his barbie snores softly, asleep, ken's still deeply engaged counting sheep. he thinks, "quit, go on strike? all these sheep look alike. what i'd give for a little bo peep." 
that your choice isn't mine there's no doubt, but it's rude to keep blessing me out. such language is brutal. opposition is futile: you know that i've ordered the trout. 
"an amusement park ride!" the man laughed. "a good stairway's secure in its craft. but your escalator trick? i feel squeamish; it's sick. moving steps?isn't that a tad daft?" 
having once gone to sea on a banker, most will hope never more to weigh anchor. the grand banks are flat cold; feeling lonesome grows old, but for more such i secretly hanker. 
someone summon the dubbing police. tourists visiting hellas say "greece," and nippon is japan? names are catch-as-catch-can. some are exonyms. o? sont les suisses? 
since they transferred you here, i can't sleep. wash your undies; they're making me weep, and you stink like a skunk, mate. i need a new bunkmate. no wonder this summer camp's cheap. 
where's the manner and speech of jane eyre? such vulgarity! don't people care? humor's filth-laden screeds; folks forgive loathsome deeds: it's contumeliousness filling our air. 
the day of accounting draws near, so be certain your ledger is clear. you'll be once again whole when you've scoured your soul: let your sins be disbosomed, my dear. 
there goes nancy, who never said "no," with her come-by-chance always in tow. gossips point and decry, still she holds her head high: with her love child, she's simply aglow. 
these old legs need some space to feel free, so it's seats behind bulkheads for me. an airplane partition is no imposition? unlike headrests assaulting each knee. 
if we deflagrate each dealer's stash? burn it up so that nothing but ash will remain of the stuff? it would show we play rough. but we'll first commandeer all their cash. 
though he loves spending time with our boys, their big daddy can't handle their noise. once he's fit to be tied, grandma moves them outside; pop returns to his man cave and toys. 
meds are futile, and most should be banned; now your ailment is way out of hand. herbal magick can cure you, it's true; i assure you, as cunning folk well understand. 
most needles are eyed, that is, "holed," but for sutures, an eyeless type's sold. an eyed needle needs threading and may cause more spreading of the gap. none want that to unfold. 
bobbi sparkles and churns with esprit; she's an everything's-great potpourri. so abandon your gloom? bobbi's brightened the room, that perpetual blithe jubilee. 
"for the night, sir? we've not yet talked pricing." "it's your hairdo, demure and enticing: those beaucatcher curls, like a sweet little girl's. you're like pastry, with spit curls like icing." 
i'm sorry; it's more than a hunch. we've detected a palpable bunch: an abdominal lump about here. feel that bump? did you wolf down a golf ball at lunch? 
stroll our garden; enjoy the mystique? paths with belgian-block paving, tres chic. each rectangular stone, settled in, overgrown, oddly cozy with age? and unique. 
dare you see yourself garbed as a shaman? you must first undergo an examen: look into your soul for that pure, divine role that distinguishes you from a layman. 
if "the?study of mankind is man," learn from choices in names what you can. research anthroponomastics, not whale songs or plastics: why dweezil, north west or just ann? 
please forgive me for twitching so much. my arm jumps and my fingers may clutch? i get spasms and jerk, interfering with work. my entasia can get me in dutch. 
your micrometer won't do the job; pack the old eriometer, bob. it can calibrate motes, measure katydid throats and delimit the web of a cob. 
where the sun's beaten down through the years, an evaporite, gypsum, appears, or a stone that you eat (sprinkle rock salt on meat), or fluorite for studs in your ears. 
we should cruise the antilles one day, soak up sun in an indolent way, skip the grill on the van tail and dive from the fantail of a ketch with a fetching buffet. 
the enameling's better than fine. ancient glass fusion work: it's divine, and though centuries old, every color's still bold. i'd pay twice what he's asking; it's mine. 
one more naughty bit cut?see his smirk? his vast outtake collection's a perk. and his line in the credits of movies he edits: "expurgatory office at work." 
we admonished him: "lay off the swill" out of neighborliness and goodwill. but the pig-headed fool had been boozing since school. now his burying's up on the hill. 
the word's gotten out; it's abroad that humanity's socially flawed: loser lads still make passes at lasses, while lasses smell wealth and are instantly thawed. 
evolutionarily, slowly, with time, we've transformed and emerged from the slime, hit-or-miss and erratic, at a pace undramatic. now we're here, is the place worth the climb? 
retired to my books and my pension, i'm enjoying an easing of tension, all angst now suppressed. i've refurbished my nest; the new sofa's divine intervention. 
this morning, it rained?just a shower? a dust settler, gone in an hour, so barely worth mention. but what got our attention? desert flora erupting in flower. 
will this factiousness rip us apart? we've been squabbling right from the start: always your camp or mine, no attempt to combine. you're a twit, so i don't give a fart. 
consistorial rulings or actions should be pondered apart from distractions. a diocesan bias assures findings are pious. church of england must tend to infractions. 
'twas a hall full of patients senescent? a parade of the slow and quiescent, some crabbing and aching, some fecklessly faking, and a few with complaints delitescent. 
i'm popular, witty and charming? charismatic. my grin is disarming. they've assigned me to hoeing, manuring and sowing, but i haven't the head for the farming. 
if we're bold, we may see the light yet. let's deleverage, pay down the debt: sell the national parks, throw detroit to the sharks? in the pink by november, no sweat. 
most equivocatory speech he's made yet: he said nothing he'll live to regret. "failing snags, we'll proceed, if all act as agreed? that's unless there's a credible threat." 
where we're bound we've already been shown; all determinative factors are known. i've no doubt or illusion: death's a foregone conclusion. and yet? it's not written in stone. 
i'm avoiding inviting pandora: she's erosive?we're flayed by her aura. my guests grow uneasy; some, unglued, flatly queasy. last easter, she wilted the flora. 
disconformable, some live apart. for these misfits, the choice would seem smart: they may croon an odd tune, shun the sun for the moon, and whenever they're moved to, they fart. 
her gaunt, yet so supple exility bespeaks an alluring agility. if we'd stage exhibitions of novel positions, that body would try my virility. 
in most things, my brother's my better: i'm complacent, while gil's a go-getter. we jogged once; it rained.  gilbert, dead-pan, explained, "i've outdone you again, bro?i'm wetter." 
an exhalant device is inserted, noxious vapors exhausted, diverted, and the system runs clean. still, the stench is obscene and so potent the town is deserted. 
you're an irish lass, bred in killeen, but your birthstone's a garnet, maureen, a sad fact that's immutable. but this garnet's suitable: the demantoid's a bright kelly green. 
an examinant asked me, "your name?" as a test question, that's fairly tame. and that's all he required; i guessed right, and was hired? aced the entrance ordeal with no shame. 
this contest already is won. that's a given: the race has begun. it's a foregone conclusion; discard all delusion. my colt will be bested by none. 
my sweet swain's a conservative chap? barn-door britches?his fly is a flap. slightly sloshed but still chipper, i felt for his zipper, and found buttons all over his lap. 
they're laying the country's foundation: busy chainmen, surveying the nation. if they stake every section with an eye to perfection, they'll save homesteaders much disputation. 
select crops for our northern location, well suited to borealization? crops with predispositions to adapt to conditions. that done, we'll attract immigration. 
this racket's an earner, for sure. it's the dodge i've been angling for: i'll appease all my cravings; i've even got savings! i will never live poor anymore. 
she's some clipper, that girl: smart and chipper. how the hell'd she wind up as a stripper? what a lap dance! good lord, she deserves an award, but there's only so much i can tip her. 
there's a cripple adjoining the creek. when my miserable world's looking bleak, in that scrubby morass i retire, lose my ass, and bask in its somber mystique. 
the establishment doesn't condone those traditions that aren't homegrown. and, since they have the power, midday naps of an hour are out. here siesta's unknown. 
who says cinema's over the hill? settle back for a swell double bill: there's a low-budget comedy with moments of dramedy, then our feature, the boys from brazil. 
this environment's dull and banal; it's been sapping my elan vital. neither changing nor growing, i fear i'm plateauing. i must soar, or i'm bound for a fall. 
for this blizzard head, best check your lighting. her blond hair, it appears, is igniting. scrap the daily routine if that flare gets onscreen. i detest when a set gets exciting. 
he won't tell us? how dare he refuse? use falanga, boys; off with his shoes. pound the soles of his feet till they look like raw meat? quite effective, and sure to amuse. 
an odd anabranch leaves the main stream, a digression in search of a theme. there are bayous that wander, explore the out yonder, and return like a dark, liquid dream. 
i just can't seem to part from miss mazie. i'm smitten; her eyes drive me crazy, and she's smart as a whip. dang, i'm losing my grip. she's the whole enchilada: a daisy! 
self-declared as both prophet-magician and bisexual, he spurned inhibition. was he wicked, unholy, this aleister crowley, or a rebel unwed to tradition? 
experimentally, joe touched her arm. she reacted, but not with alarm. "don't be shy," said her eyes, so he tried for the prize. she said, "stop," but a sigh said, "no harm." 
the room's mirrored for weddings and balls: hung in enfilade?opposite walls. you'll see gowns in reflection in every direction. next season, we mirror the halls. 
bees are swarming once more at the blacks'; procreation there's come off the tracks. poor old granny's lost count, begged her boys to dismount, take a year off, or three? and relax. 
the performers are marionettes on their undersized, colorful sets? fantoccini, on strings, doing spellbinding things? entrechats and well-turned pirouettes. 
would you plant every foot of your field? use a cascrom to heighten your yield. it's an old scottish trick: fix a plow to a stick. for the strapping, it's simple to wield. 
the great steamboat refused me aboard, though i'd sweetly cajoled and implored. still, they rigged a cordelle, towed me north for a spell. far abaft in my raft, i'm ignored. 
black ice formed a skin on the pond. from the shoreline it stretched far beyond? so transparent, yet thin, wayward chipmunks fell in. and, lamentably, children were conned. 
in they slouch, drawers adroop, caps arake (studied angles), and all on the make. all is carefully planned to seem cool and offhand, but there's method; they've image at stake. 
all these dinner plans, man?hold your horses! you've been days just deciding on courses. your cibarious musing is growing confusing. twelve cookbooks? cut back on your sources! 
that's a breviograph letter compression, for a document?will or confession. they're not fancy baroques, but unique simple strokes, like john hancocks, but done with discretion. 
will the chic, fashion-forward be there, in their next-season rags and wild hair? must stay focused and steady? can i ever be ready? i've eleven short months to prepare. 
here i stand, in soaked barvel, filleting. you bitch at the figure you're paying. life at sea's more than dicey, so fresh fish is pricey. while you're home eating bluefish, we're praying. 
from the first hated cockcrow of morn, it's the season of harvesting corn. then all evening we husk, right from noon and through dusk? so it's been since my daddy was born. 
this just in from a weather balloon: it should fair off and dry out by noon. but my grandpappy's gout puts that forecast in doubt. toe's still throbbing; expect a monsoon. 
wicked wind's whipping in off the shore, as a devil dancer's rattling the door. mini-whirlwinds are eerie. but the fireside is cheery. let's cuddle up warm, mi amor. 
on the menu's an entree of chevon: roasted goat meat's a meal sent from heaven. keep your kid; it's not ripe; i'm the nanny meat type. on a one to six scale, it's a seven. 
capoeiristas perform in the square during carnival; everyone's there. with its formalized fighting, complex and exciting. a nameless allure fills the air. 
his insignia's apt for a star, its emblazonment blared from afar: from the maw of t. rex hang two blood-soaked execs? a strong statement, if somewhat bizarre. 
you've been friending too hastily, friends. be aware of these late-breaking trends: some who'd pose as your cronies, social media phonies, are but facecrooks with villainous ends. 
when i'm at myself, man, i'm sublime: won't be bested when i'm in my prime. no debate or delay? just get out of my way, 'cause today i've got mountains to climb. 
here the climate had long been contrary: a new reason each season?be wary. then a decade of drought drove most sodbusters out. the dirty thirties brought hell to the prairie. 
stacks of essays, and each one wants scoring? disquisitional tracts, though, are boring. i sit down with a stack, grab a pencil, lean back, and press on to the business of snoring. 
a harsh comment's a dangerous thing. break it off in him, man, make it sting! had enough of his crap? try a sharp verbal slap. shut him up and you've grabbed the brass ring. 
with our harvest days reaching a peak, there's an apple bee friday next week, when our orchards' sweet pride is prepared to be dried. the occasion's all style and technique. 
broadcast excerpts from each of his speeches to wherever our strong signal reaches. precious leader's sweet words fill our air like the birds: golden portions of what master preaches. 
must we feel all the pebbles and bumps? we've arrived, but we've taken our lumps; a short jaunt on that cart nearly tore us apart the damned farting-trap's ruined our rumps. 
enantiopathic medicaments may ease us through painful predicaments. if an ache is extreme, i try palliative cream, not a lozenge: they're weak and i'm sick o' mints. 
my damned spell-checker's at it? again. certain terms are beyond the thing's ken. the cupertino effect made my laptop correct my word cyan. it's chosen cayenne. 
insignificant? think of your skin, and the casings throughout your within. so don't make it an issue: epithelial tissue is crucial for holding stuff in. 
from old ulster they've come to our state, all these far-downs?but, yank, get this straight: all these prods just can't be quite as irish as we, so it's donnybrook time, just you wait. 
"that protuberant boss thou shouldst toss! it appeareth bizarre, lord, a loss." "this location's precise; it's his smelling device, called a nose," spake the ultimate boss. 
there's vibration? is that how she feels? have you properly balanced her wheels? that odd shudder abates once you've hung the right weights. so complete the job; don't drag your heels. 
a banana is easily peeled? excoriable?swiftly unsealed, which reminds me of jennie, who'd strip for a penny, charms candidly, proudly revealed. 
a grenade's blown a hole in his gut. eventration's resulted there, but the new corpsman's no quack. he can shove the bowel back and, pro tem, maybe stitch the kid shut. 
"with powerful legs his main feature, a gazelle's a cursorial creature: he's speedy, not cunning, and a wizard at running." dad's retired, but still a top teacher. 
harvard's child ballads' influence spoke through that burgeoning song style called folk. this scholar's collection changed music's complexion as themes with tradition awoke. 
"leveled blades," said our sculls coach once more, "flat feathered, in line with the shore. now a fresh stroke from scratch: drop it in for the catch, and the drive?that's what rowers are for." 
they're adjusting; i'll not be judgmental. still, the times has gone all continental: daily feuilleton pages? our press dies in stages. light fiction?the death should be gentle. 
the vast desert's a featureless waste, as though god slapped it down in great haste: neither valley nor rise, just those infinite skies? then las vegas, so fittingly placed. 
yes, a featherless biped, that's me. any right-thinking man would agree. call me "pennate"? absurd! do i eat like a bird? and i'm hairy as hairy can be. 
he was reared in a seamy bordello; his skin's a diseased shade of yellow. rather worn and unclean for a lad of eighteen, he's in less than fine fettle, this fellow. 
attach? case is proper, not bag, you provincial, illiterate hag. right, it doesn't hold much: a few treaties and such. (such a lack of respect makes me gag.) 
our executive: how he's enstyled must be set, be he loved or reviled. "your high mightiness," "sire," or "this flintlock for hire"? "mr. president"?forceful, yet mild. 
for his polis alexis is straining; he's ephebic, and so, yet in training. but born greek and born free, he'll soon leave his mom's knee, which, alone, seems a goal worth attaining. 
some leave steles for the future to see, even statues, by royal decree. all i leave is my rhyme to sustain me through time. perhaps words will eternalize me. 
pre-war, getting in was a breeze. exfiltration, though, came by degrees: agents left through the cracks, one by one, hiding tracks, under boxcars, afloat or on skis. 
edward's grown too inquisitive lately: gotten irksome, disturbing us greatly. oh, he's frustrated, is he? our deforciant's been busy. ed won't quit if he's dealt with sedately. 
an old ellwand's a draper's device used when near, not precise, will suffice. "cut me ten yards of terry." "that's exact?" "well, not very." "as i measure, let's haggle a price." 
it was brutal: their words should have hurt. he hurled "birdbrain!" she countered "stuffed shirt!" in a bitter exchange. so their conduct seemed strange when she slid his hand under her skirt. 
"due to diageotropism, plants spread outward, not upward," he rants. "but its function's still muddy and needs further study. i've applied for some government grants." 
she was extroverted, rashly off-track, unreserved?it sure took me aback. she was free and disarming, so openly charming? and exotically wild in the sack. 
it's a clear designatory mark that identifies this new world lark. such distinguishing features help identify creatures while we're birding each spring at the park. 
their wedlock, resilient, coheres. some sweet extract of blessings and tears, some conglutinative stuff, both elastic and tough, still holds, and the flame perseveres. 
it's monstrous; you've got to concede that our government's grown like a weed: all expanding dimensions, growing wings and extensions. on what meat doth our great seizer feed? 
i get lost from the den to the loo; once arrived, i've no clue what to do. and i'm usually late (my confusional state) for appointments? except those with you. 
the promotion was mine, but the cost! by this faustian compact, i'm lost. for this fleeting control, i would squander my soul? does it count if my fingers were crossed? 
what a cruise! an erotic excursion, in debauchery quite an immersion, on the pool chairs, on decks, it's been pure joy of sex: orgiastic! a festal perversion. 
there's a festschrift devoted to bloom by his colleagues. i dared to presume to contribute a piece on his lectures on greece, but the editors claimed there's no room. 
it was great till you got here, i swear, till you brought your disheartening air. so depart these festivities; your dreary proclivities will deaden the whole damned affair. 
what i'm holding, a flush, should be sound; still, he's bumping me round after round, adding more to the pot. what the hell has he got? better fold, or i'll never rebound. 
decommissioned, our frigate's still cool, though a drag to refit and retool. when we're booking her cruises, her uniqueness amuses. that ex-warship's our company jewel. 
ammo stashed in a brown paper bag: tapered boat-tails with very low drag say this guy is our sniper. he'll soon pay the piper for a crime that's been making tongues wag. 
dee's got plans for diablerie?watch! as a trickster, her plots are top-notch. she's been challenged by friends, so she somehow intends to expose poor penelope's crotch. 
though our garden group lives for dissension, your fernery's earned our attention: fern varieties galore, some not grown here before. it's awarded a "worthy of mention." 
"never judge: films should always play fair." "no, take sides:  it shows filmmakers care." "let the viewers decide." "they're along for the ride. you're ambivalent!" "you're all hot air!" 
this epigraph opens his tome on the native's enchantment with rome: "while young wanderlust's fine, one's foundation's divine." it's his theme, and he will bring it home. 
life's too brief to be dull and uptight. sweet diversions deliver delight: entertainment's a treat that makes life more complete, so let me entertain you? tonight. 
he's a broomtail, all fire and esprit? wild and worthless?you'd best set him free. all these mustangs, these ponies, should run with their cronies. they belong to the land, can't you see? 
he's neglected, and yet tommy learns: touching candent (white hot) objects burns. tommy finds the surprises of danger's disguises while mom studies as the world turns. 
a tic's just an uncontrolled twitch. nerves contract. it's a junior grade glitch of the briefest duration, a mild fasciculation enjoyed by the poor and the rich. 
that's my clam gun, a tubular spade, used for hunting the best meals god made, the ideal sort of gizmo for quahog or pismo or cherrystone?all are top grade. 
i'm admiring that buttermilk sky; it's a curd-speckled feast for the eye. patchy puffs on the blue marching past in review are like cream-covered pastries on high. 
does your mindset produce what we see? too conceptualistic for me. though ideas might be lyrical, the real is empirical. your theories and mine don't agree. 
any complementizer like that in "i know that your wife's an old bat" introduces a clause without comma or pause. now you know, keep it under your hat. 
what's fuzzy is cuddly and tickles; what's echinulate's covered in prickles. yet my hedgehog's not horrible as a pet: she's adorable. look, somebody slept with don rickles. 
both sons kidnapped, we lived on just prayer; you unearthed them with no time to spare. your emancipative measures delivered our treasures. one more prayer: give the bastards the chair. 
a used book store, a hand-lettered label: "find romance on the mysteries table," and behold, she's right there? time to act, but with care. crash! fool mysteries table's unstable. 
move the loot if you have any sense to a pawn shop or, better, a fence. when conditions turn prickly, a fence will pay quickly. his cut's just a business expense. 
his sanity hangs by a thread; a commotion's at work in his head: frenzied ferment so strong that he'll crack before long, with an impact that's best left unsaid. 
endozoic plants thrive in a gut. to avoid them, just keep your trap shut. the plants' menu keeps changing every hour, rearranging, but nutritious and moist, so, so what? 
there are sorrows we cannot contain, as with helen, her heart cleft in twain. plagued by trials and fears, she broke down, and her tears spawned the herb we call elecampane. 
my wife is renowned as a cook, while her husband's the consummate schnook. it was anise i sought for her, fennel i've bought for her. "but that smell, hon." "it's labelled. here, look." 
finn's removing to finland, you dope, where his home's not on fenland, we hope, because low, marshy ground sounds unwholesome, unsound. with helsinki we think he can cope. 
if, when running, your foot falls afoul of the hole of a burrowing owl right there in the track, set your jaw and bounce back: many joggers just naturally scowl. 
bring your passion, your lover, your cash to our annual midsummer bash. once the gala ignites with its festival lights, raise hell; they'll blink out in a flash. 
at an orgy, who brews the fondue, selects sheets for each wild, wooly screw? who runs wingdings for kings, or just complicates things? what does an event planner do? 
family built this place; gramps lives there still? and keeps farming?and running the mill. there he still keeps his hand in. no way he'd abandon the bank barn built into the hill. 
this wall scowls at me, absent of grace. two fenestrae should liven the place: high fanlights designed with twin sunbursts in mind? final touch for your cramped eastern face. 
it was fenceless and free on the range, but to settlers, such freedom was strange. to delimit the space, they would barb-wire the place: sound perimeters, practical change. 
he was fondling a favorite mace, fell ferity writ on his face and the brains of a cabbage. good lord, he looked savage. it seemed prudent to give the brute space. 
i've been longing for shut-eye, although it's the night of the grand fais do-do, biggest dance of the year? there'll be zydeco, beer? i've decided to let myself go. 
it's but silver my digging is for; that's my quest: argentiferous ore. my personal grail? something comstock in scale, for a start; it's a grind to live poor. 
cousin fester breeds roaches on bran; auntie flo wed a con in the can, and poor stu up in storrs ain't yet learned to work doors. feeblemindedness runs in our clan. 
cast aspersions at those you may need? burning bridges seems foolish, indeed. should you ever descend to back-capping a friend? if his wife looks delicious? proceed. 
what i borrowed i thought i'd repay; now it's exigible?due?by today. no reprieves, no revising (somber music is rising)? damn shylock won't meet me halfway. 
johnson's nearly the last of his breed; men like him today never succeed. in this world, it's not viable to be frank and reliable? and johnson's a bit off his feed. 
while his small market team is just stewing, it's his walk year and battles are brewing, which for him is sublime, 'cause it's bidding war time: the pursuing, the wooing, the screwing. 
he was lazy, bereft of ambition, so he ceded his potent position. his abdicated seat is in want of fresh meat. contact casting. arrange an audition. 
these unusual fossils we've found in this stream bed right here on the ground, are called belemnites, folks. they're no fossil hound's hoax, though not often found lying around. 
that dimpled, adorable rump shall be mine. it's so perfectly plump. her posterior beauteous? sweet maximus gluteus? makes my ticker go thumpity-thump. 
you pretend that you don't give a damn, but your man is a batterer, ma'am. come on, cast the creep loose; why endure his abuse? meanwhile, call when you're next in a jam. 
those attenuated rumbles of thunder, like the heavens were splitting asunder, are weak and still distant but dark and persistent. the herd's become skittish?no wonder. 
we're a thousand miles eastbound from seoul when the barostat loses control. cabin pressure's gone mad; this is sure to be bad: down below's just a vast swimming hole. 
a good wing shooter here wouldn't fail. daily bag limit's two dozen quail. the preserve sets the cap; i'm a practical chap. still, demand this month's right off the scale. 
while this vista's deserving of fame, it wants focus and bounds all the same. so add outlining to it: use a claude glass to view it. a scene is improved in a frame. 
time to cast off my dark discontent and atone for the years i've misspent, time to feast and run riot; i commend you to try it: divorce as a  festive event. 
the elements here are erratic, so we've climatized, cellar to attic: a home weather station, top grade insulation, and no windows. one must be pragmatic. 
we arrive at or part from a place with abrazos, our hearty embrace, always done like we mean it. don't, please, intervene: it might lead to a slight loss of face. 
the earl's abditory, recently found in his chapel and half underground ('neath the rood screen, disguised) still held much the man prized. it's been lost since the last earl was drowned. 
comes to baking a fine cherry pie, you're the queen and far abler than i. so no lies or evasions: for family occasions, i'll respectfully never apply. 
stop the search; here's our cover shot, guys. check the catchlight in kathy's brown eyes: only barely detected where the fill light's reflected? unplanned, but a pleasant surprise. 
it's calumniously worded, i'd judge; this review claims your bistro sells sludge that's as thick as old toffee. it slanders your coffee. someone's nursing one helluva grudge. 
here's an option i haven't explored: i've read coins were once buccally stored? in the owners' own cheeks (for the nonce, not for weeks). that might kill the temptation to hoard. 
male or female? for me that's complex, so i live, you might say, "between decks." on this last application, i've delayed confrontation: not yet bubbled in is "your sex." 
they trudge wearily, droopy and drained, their eyes blearily murky and strained, still robotically plodding, half dead but all nodding, marching discipline barely maintained. 
all struggled, some died, but they came for adventure and fortune and fame: over seas, from back east (gold awakened their beast), each one hustling to stake out a claim. 
with the snowmelt come sweet april rains, carried off in ephemeral drains. spring's come home to our hollows and hills, and what follows reminds us the circle remains. 
they're colloguing, they've something in store. those old rascals are scheming once more. once the play's underway, some poor sucker will pay. sure, they're scoundrels, but never a bore. 
we've air-conditioned guido; he's through, and no longer a menace to you. the grotesque little troll's head to toe full of holes. ventilation was long overdue. 
he's been coddled, indulged? what's the phrase? that's it: farting through silk all his days? loads of money, no soul. i say, dig him a hole. put him under; he's set in his ways. 
we use countercathexis to block weird desires that would otherwise shock: if my uncontrolled id craves a squid, god forbid, it's rebuffed with no need to take stock. 
in vaudeville, timing was king, and your place on the bill was the thing. the deuce spot was shunned, so performers were stunned if assigned second slot in the string. 
in the biz, with my stature at stake, the damn press wouldn't cut me a break. then a dialect act spoke of things that i lacked. but from them it was easy to take. 
we hung out once, and partied and flirted. now the last has "gone home"; i'm deserted. though i'm here, safe and sound, my whole world's in the ground. sure, i get it. i'm still disconcerted. 
"that hideous roar's from a dumb-bull? just checking?you've been known to mumble." "it's a primitive drum pierced by string you don't strum." "ike, your folk learnin' makes me feel humble." 
at the track, he's in dreadnought and chaps? he's expecting a blizzard, perhaps? a wool greatcoat in summer? he gets weirder and dumber. wait! it's worse: now the loon's running laps. 
skewed shapes are the chief imperfection of a pure equal-area projection. the extent of each state may be true but i hate the map's edge?its eccentric complexion. 
that devil's not clergiable; he takes no counsel, prefers to think free. his response to all clerics? unbridled hysterics. my advice, pastor: let the fool be. 
what drains ardor from most diabetics? might pizzazz be perked up with synthetics? why, with age, do we alter? must potency falter? such questions involve energetics. 
that's too over-the-top; as you were. your portrayal's not what i prefer. it's a techie rebellion; you're a nerd, not a hellion: your model's ben stein, not ben-hur. 
deep divisions are yet unresolved; there are too many factors involved? bridges sundered and burned where religion's concerned. these are problems that won't soon be solved. 
daisy's days of dishonor draw near: spinster schoolmarm whom no man holds dear. her kid sister's to wed; daisy's lonesome in bed. she'll dance in the hog trough, we fear. 
the cape buffalo's horns are quite wide: he's eurycerous. horns are his pride. i won't leave it unsaid that the breadth of his head is misleading. there's not much inside. 
i can finally hold up my chin. sales are booming; the dust's pouring in, and i'm suddenly rich. still, there's one tragic glitch: how to ditch my danged wife and her kin! 
it was careless?a venial mistake. she deserves, i insist, a fair shake; you've overreacted. she was drowsy, distracted, when she sat on the president's cake. 
from my works you may cite a small part, says the statute, but know from the start: follow rules of fair use (which are, sadly, abstruse), or my lawyers will tear out your heart. 
i'm a stone crusher, bub, and proud of it. i pulverize rocks, and i love it. keep your gun; i don't travel. i have fun and make gravel. don't get it, you blockhead? then shove it! 
against needing it later next week, i've a stash in a cache by the creek. i'll remember the place, and return there, in case? as a lift if i've had a bad streak. 
as our plans, in the end, coalesced, our concerns, bit by bit, evanesced? dissolved slowly, like dew. with the tension gone too, why the hell were we both so depressed? 
so the boss found a new fair-haired boy? her advisor/companion?her toy. soon she'll learn he's a rat, and discard him? like that? a comeuppance i itch to enjoy. 
logorrhea we all should deplore, but for speakers, less may not be more. epexegetically adding that phrase wasn't padding. it clarified what went before, 
i've got several ageable aunts absolutely addicted to dance. though all long in the tooth, they seem graceful with youth in terpsichore's magical trance. 
says the pilot, "smooth sailing's ahead: western seas lie ensanguined in red. look, they mirror the skies." but the captain just sighs, "dusk encrimsoned just fills me with dread." 
she sends love notes to one lucky guy? all encoded. the angel's too shy to post love in the open, so she lies abed hopin' he deciphers who's sent them, and why. 
some marine life's enjoyed a long run, like echinoderms, starfish for one. most regenerate parts (limbs or spines, if not hearts). such resiliency won't be outdone. 
once they flocked from a corner of spain to find work in our mountain domain. expert herders of sheep, basco talents came cheap, and their work ethic? hard to explain. 
back her up till you feel a slight shock? till her tailgate's end on with the dock. then our crew will begin to just slide the load in. they work fast when they're not on the clock. 
adolescents go crazy and squeal; you expect me to grovel and kneel? he's a no-talent pest and i'm flat unimpressed. so he gyrates to music?big deal! 
he's arrested, but folks, be discreet. pretty soon he's back haunting your street. so contain your excitement; it's just an indictment. he don't care: it's a smudge on his sheet. 
let's examine the veins of this leaf, their aberrant excurrent motif, reaching outward, beyond a leaf's natural bond. unprotected, they're in for some grief. 
i swear the man swells by the hour, every day an extension of power. though he once seemed a savior, from this latest behavior some grovel and some basely cower. 
she's the final girl still in contention, with grace and astounding extension: her foot poised overhead. if she does that in bed, she's in line for a chunk of my pension. 
during lockdowns, my school is unreal, with its prison-like, carceral feel: from cold gray cement walls to armed guards in the halls. need a pee? that's a freakish ordeal. 
hit the sack at the beach again, jack? further proof of the judgment you lack. now you're baked flaming red like a lobster shack spread, and there's blistering all down your back. 
check out what the wind just blew in: andy gump of the fadeaway chin. there are lips, there are teeth, then there's nothing beneath but a fizzle of bone-challenged skin. 
our new spire being built by the preacher is his project, his baby?his creature. its minutest detail he's pursued as his grail. he adores its most trivial feature. 
her cat tigger's unfurling its claws, her mouth fanged like some snakes' upper jaws. as she coldly observes him, her posture unnerves him. "i'm not dinner," he thinks, and withdraws. 
that skunk! he came on like a rose, but he's stuck on himself, and it shows. he grows less and less saintly, that fake halo glows faintly. i propose we depose him. he goes! 
i was all around stocking up gold, then got canned?put investing on hold. lately, life's about nearly. i've survived, if austerely, so i'm all around feeling consoled. 
come settle my marshland with me. yes, it's rugged and damp, i agree. who might live where it's fenny? i'll grant you: not many, but the few find it lush and low-key. 
in his barracan jacket and hat, the old gentleman lounged on his mat. in this heat? how absurd! before long the man stirred. i've learned much from that old desert rat. 
"catch our new girl: the never-says-nyet one." "a duke's mixture, if ever i met one." "she's russian-hawaiian and her name is o'brien." "i'm in love! where the heck can i get one?
"god's forgiveness is nearly consumed. all are sinners," our minister fumed. "but we few know the way to survive the dark day. present parties excepted, we're doomed." 
her hair's cropped; it's her signature do, cut so short that her scalp's showing through, and the common belief that it's everywhere brief is a subject i yearn to pursue, 
passed around in the old hobo camps, watered down and denatured for tramps by some heartless distiller, that dehorn's a killer. some were lucky, and only got cramps. 
all your strutting and fanfaronade is so bogus?a vulgar fa?ade. how you posture and crow! why the girls buy your show is a puzzlement, honest to god. 
so what? so i donned the wrong hat. still, i'll likely catch flak about that. it was white tie and topper, so my homburg's improper? more grief from the wife (the old bat). 
look, the president's boiling the frog, so his plan's being launched at a jog. once the strategy's plain, we're inured to the pain. then the rest rolls out harsh and whole-hog. 
once an eagle owl came for my kitty as i watched; the results were not pretty. but nature's not neat; even owls need to eat. call the kitties-are-cuties committee. 
why so shocked you're suspended? pathetic. your migration's electrophoretic. charged particle motions in a gel or most lotions are predictable, sure?not frenetic. 
friday nights, at the burleycue show, there they sat, gawking up from below: aging bankers and schemers? in the dark, merely dreamers? up front in the bald-headed row. 
our old "bintel brief" columns were full of dilemmas of family and schul: yiddish bubbes and schneiders, most lower east siders, wanting answers?no preaching, no bull. 
she's a solid old cabin?my pride. she's "all wool and, it's said,  a yard wide," built of fieldstone and timber (i was young, then, and limber), with dependable fixtures inside. 
lewis carroll, a-dabbling in verse gave us toves labelled slithy, and, worse, still succumbing to whimsy made borogoves mimsy. i pray none of these is a curse. 
the pot's cretan, though found near beirut: basic biscuit with barbotine fruit. sadly, baked-on clay slip can too easily chip, but on this piece, the flaking's minute. 
impervious, rigid, unbowed, the dancer, en pointe, appeared proud: her epaulement, side-on, at the act's denouement, was admired by all eyes in the crowd. 
here's a dandyfunk made by my niece, of molasses, crushed biscuit and grease. a no-nonsense ship's cook, she prepares by the book. if you're tempted to gripe, keep your peace. 
there's a boiling arch outside of town where our maple sap's long been boiled down: this old furnace of brick has for years turned the trick. local syrup's earned worldwide renown. 
the aprilian winds have brought damps and lumbago and muscular cramps. but we'll soon go a-maying. come june, we'll be haying, as always, like granny and gramps. 
at the moment, we want room to store stuff: obscene figurines and decor stuff. but the chest won't align. this encoignure works fine: unobtrusive and holds even more stuff. 
we'll be plucking that crown-beard this week? not king george's (that fussy antique), but those aster-like blooms which should brighten our rooms. they're intruders with overmuch cheek. 
as we miscreants long have been dreading, evangelicalism's lately been spreading: preachers getting the word out, and urging the herd out to church. these are times of hard sledding. 
older sisters can keep you in stitches, and i plied mine with hows, whys and whiches. caught her naked in bed, and "what's that fer?" i said. "that's my cat's fur to make kitten britches." 
double eagles are mentioned in wills although face value's just twenty bills. each such coin in your hand should fetch over a grand. got a box? move to beverly hills. 
copulation's my lifelong obsession, so sleep's but a squandered digression. in the words of my ex, "god knows you love sex." (if god knows, then i'm skipping confession.) 
she was eagerness?quick to excite; now there's iciness, stiff and polite. have i come on too strong? where's her heat? what's gone wrong? driven off by the cool of the night. 
sure, we're floundering?that i'll concede. you say time's of the essence. agreed. why not flat-out confess the whole system's a mess? more postponements are not what we need. 
with all discord discussed and allayed, all agreed-upon changes now made: raw materials, siting, the sharp golden lighting? junior's ready to sell lemonade. 
that cantankerous, angry old cuss, not affiliated, thank you, with us, has of late, nonetheless, used our name with the press. he's not ours?nothing more to discuss. 
adhered algae is fouling my yacht. the crud's glued to my hull; it's near shot. add the barnacles, slime and now tubeworms and grime? my retirement is going to pot. 
years and years of accumulating debt: so much waste. why are so few upset? "the economy's healthy; we'll soak all the wealthy?" the word from the president's jet. 
criminy! what did you do? it'll kindle a hullabaloo. like a pinball game's "tilt," you've brought down what we built. even privately, that word's taboo. 
i demand, in my kitchen, control, with the bliss point my ultimate goal. every dish i present is a flawless event: a consummate, sublime, perfect whole. 
though a dope puller's job's never pleasant, it's the best luke can land for the present. he hides his distaste as he clears greasy waste from the lube box?fine work, for a peasant. 
by the great hall the bottlery stands, stocking all that fine feasting demands. so what's held within shines: rare provisions, fine wines. and its bounty, with richness, expands. 
as a fencer, i duel each day. should you cross me, you'd best drop and pray. let me catch you off guard and i'll  come at you hard, armed with cutlass?no wussy epee. 
our bedchamber vista's our best, where the land drops away to the west. are we less than demure? is it wicked? i'm sure. still we savor each sunset? undressed. 
choose our venue, provide a warm start: spanish moss on live oaks; you'll look smart? your occasion's reality, our old south hospitality in the big house, the farmstead's vast heart. 
i go bushwhacking off-trail with friends, and by sunset each hike often ends. volunteering as searchers, we feel the work nurtures the keenness that nature intends. 
second booking?an obvious foul? he's sent off now; it's futile to howl. down a man, there's no chance for our side to advance, but we can't simply throw in the towel. 
epexegetic enhancements are free: added words meant to help the crowd see what's the point, what's the gist, to burn off mental mist, but go easy, you don't want a scree. 
bird's nest pudding? now, where do i start? it's a custardy baked apple tart with a crisp golden crust (now, that "crisp" part's a must)? grandma's recipe?close to my heart. 
you claim deference. why? based on what? on your vestments? your girth? surely not! your inherited worth, or based solely on birth? you're a zero: the sultan of squat. 
for a time i've been trying my hand as a fence rider, girdling the land: fallen posts, mangled wires, meet my shovel and pliers. it don't pay, but the setting is grand. 
a raccoon had his way with the cat in the barnyard one night; feature that! hard to credit? well, maybe, but the cat's dropped her baby. it reminds me of daniel boone's hat. 
please repeat that; i'm losing my head. any chance it was "let's go to bed"? my due diligence slipped when you stood and unzipped, and, diverted, i missed what you said. 
bill buckley's a well-known eristic. i'll debate him, but be realistic: he'll prevail; that's his game? likely put me to shame, and ingeniously: buckley's artistic. 
brother morgan, the preacher, declaims about godless, accursed hand-held games. then he spies mrs. morgan blasting orcs at the organ. his glare makes her burst into flames. 
in the pillow where gran laid her head was a feather crown?there, on the bed? shaped by angels, some say, for her last placid day. she'd be welcomed, the mass clearly said. 
watch your skirt; take the  cross thwart, my dear. (my, she's tasty, examined from here.) yes, the skiff's seats are low: a bit awkward, i know. (what a bonus?her panties are sheer!) 
our honeymoon, sadly, was brief: that first day, we fetched up on a reef and then waged our first quarrel up high on the coral. make-up sex is beyond all belief. 
fetch about, cap; thar's weather ahead. change our tack or we'll all wind up dead. this is hurricane season; ain't that enough reason? my sweetie waits warm in our bed. 
work, work, work since the day i was hired; now i'm frazzled and so fetching tired. it'll mean taking flak, but now on i'll ease back. why obsess? i'll do just what's required. 
i'd been drifting a rather long while, then fetched up on my tropical isle, safely beached and ashore, fish and breadfruit galore. what, me worry? i'm living in style. 
use a crush spread when trading in soybeans (matters not if you hate or enjoy beans): concurrently buying and selling, defying the trends?a fine way to employ beans. 
a danseuse limbers up at the barre stirring visions intense and bizarre. how deliciously fetching there, bending and stretching? enchanting! but dreams go too far. 
before she does it, you do the same: beat the bitch at her own nasty game. next time she drops the ball, don't let her make the call: let everyone know who's to blame. 
he's a person of huge consequentiality, once the soul of this rural locality. yet why has he slipped, his great eminence chipped? something lurid?some crude triviality. 
in an alcove, there's curved marble seating used for many an intimate meeting? trysts sweet but forbidden. the exedra's hidden from those on the lookout for cheating. 
closed drainage holds run-off from rains that a pond, lake or basin retains. with no efflux, no route for a stream to flow out, into inland depressions it drains. 
that carnivorous look in his eyes makes her feel like two hot dogs with fries. so it seems he's esurient, not lustful and prurient? he drools as he ogles her thighs. 
cooked, briarroot tolerates heat, so the shrub is a pipe maker's treat. it's a middling sized tree grown throughout the maquis yielding wood that's a smoker's elite. 
we've got hardhats who don't break a sweat, but just stand 'round the site getting wet. not a one can be fired; they're all union-required: damn featherbedding?screws with our net. 
he's desacralized; don't call him "saint." but i couldn't tell auntie?she'd faint. broke the news to her slowly; she insisted, "he's holy. sure, he's answered my every complaint." 
crowded worksites feel barren and sad, so a cube farm's no place for a lad? or a lass, come to that (prairie dogging to chat). claustrophobia's driving us mad. 
disrespect can't be borne; this means war! we'll ensanguine the hills with their gore. let their rivers run red. let the worms  eat their dead. we'll lay waste till our sword arms are sore. 
being always deplorably late makes an odious start for a date. what we've planned for the night rarely opens just right, but the close makes it seem worth the wait. 
my profligate ways need recasting, so i'll pray during two weeks of fasting. mustn't beg the lord's grace while i'm stuffing my face? play this right, i'll have life everlasting. 
a breaking plow slices tough roots, busting sod laced with rhizomes and shoots. once an eight-oxen team, later diesel or steam drew this blessing no farmer disputes. 
someone neuter him now, or he'll spawn. his mentality's that of a prawn. he's convinced that he knows; that's as far as it goes? that holier-than-thou bien-pensant. 
it seemed people were losing their charm, and i needed a shot in the arm. i've found somewhere to go that's helped soften the blow. as a cushion, i'm leasing a farm. 
move right! something hot's coming through. join the crawler lane's leisurely queue. you're beginning to fade, you can't handle this grade. i've got juice, but it's too steep for you. 
these expatriate delicatessens teach behavior-based, usable lessons: though folks move far away, tastes of home every day fend off homesickness?foods can be blessin's. 
quit your soapbox a minute. let's chat. i'm accustomed to living with fat. i grow ampler and ampler with each whitman's sampler. i will not give up chocolate; that's that! 
what a wall-to-wall mind, and elastic? "eco-sutures"?the concept's fantastic! such conceptual blends often influence trends. this man's genius i'd call esemplastic. 
he's away on his quest to behold the fabled lost cities of gold (of tradition and song). he's been gone a bit long. i blame mapquest; its sources are old. 
in ors, exposed fingers are banned. we use finger cots here. understand? sort of condoms for midgets or rubbers for digits, they ward off tiny cuts on your hand. 
we've had applicants, man, and a ton of 'em. next we'll fingerprint every last one of 'em. once the grooves on their fingers help sort out the ringers, bet your ass we'll be hiring none of 'em. 
while the rest of us gossiped and ate, you fastidiously poked at your plate. "the damn eggs are too runny; i expect clover honey." your pickiness made us all late. 
finno-ugric, of magyar and finnish, is a language group spread kind of thin-ish. sounding odd, they're a struggle to learn for this muggle as i age and my talents diminish. 
with dinner tonight we had beet greens, though my wife's well aware i don't eat greens. she says i should diet; i'll grudgingly try it. guess what's hiding a small piece of meat? greens. 
her bien-pensant, orthodox mind is just not to dissension inclined. she's always been taught, life has no second thought: what god wrought needn't be redesigned. 
when i said, "sibyl brought down the house," it was figurative. sibyl's a mouse, and too weak for such feats. but the crowd left their seats when she gracefully peeled off her blouse. 
he's been fiercely attacked in the press. he's no longer their darling, i guess. they've lit into him?hard. now he's skittish and scarred? a bit much for a drubbing in chess. 
back when rommel was more than a comer, he was field marshal, facing montgomery. their combative commands braved north african sands. it was hot (just a summery summary). 
audie field-strips his weapon like that! it's in pieces in twelve seconds flat. when he tries reassembly, his fingers turn trembly. at the test range, hold on to your hat. 
she approaches; my loin starts to stir. i'd resist, but my mind is a blur. she'll move mountains with sex, with that heat she projects. raw eroticism's natural to her. 
children's games have a clean ebb and flow? simple rules in a simple tableau. "annie-over!" we call; friends unseen chase the ball. certain joys i've no wish to outgrow. 
he's discovered the joys of the bed. now he's altar-bound, yearning to wed. at church picnics and dances he's taking his chances. he'll seek till that hankering's fed. 
my hound cold-trails a man with the best. each pursuit is relentless, obsessed. though a creep escapee may believe he's home free, before long, he's back under arrest. 
his idea'd never reach execution; it's a facilely formed contribution, sensitivities, specs? this issue's complex: arctic trash heaps won't wipe out pollution. 
air your lungs; it will do you no good? can't imagine whyever it should. all that piercing profanity! some question your sanity. you're bound to be misunderstood. 
now the cab of my train's overhauled, with new safety equipment installed. no more "trainload goodbye" if i black out or die? dead man's handle, it's cheerfully called. 
this defoliated tree will soon die. someone's cruelly murdered this guy. he's been chemically scalded? denuded and balded. he'll regenerate? pie in the sky. 
this now abrogated contract's defunct, and, worthless, deserved to be junked. its parameters? useless. executors? juice-less. the team that conceived it has flunked. 
declining prices? well, what's going down: blue chip stocks or a night on the town? though if wall street flat tanks, that night out might mean franks, chick-fil-a or some joint with a clown. 
bob and jilly are parents ? at last. jilly cockers the kid; bob's aghast. the squirt's coddled, protected, but bob's just dejected: wild sex is a thing of the past. 
"bare thy blade and avert not thy eye; there's a dragon, a firedrake nearby: a huge, fierce flying snake whose hot breath would thee bake." wizard warnings one daren't defy. 
damn! the field hands are fixin' to strike. i'll have somebody's head on a spike. only firebrands win if the crops ain't brought in. union meddlers should all take a hike. 
catastrophically out of control, he's exploding from deep in his soul. rage endogenously grown, fury bred in the bone must abate, but will first take its toll. 
he's a prophet, he claims, and sees far, but his armomancy's worse than bizarre. read my shoulder bones? nuts! he's a quack and a putz? and the soul of o'shaughnessy's bar. 
as a firebreak, this clearing is lame. all this brush is just fuel to a flame. we cut clean for a reason: this hot, windy season. do it right or i'll know who's to blame. 
she was dappled: her cheeks and her nose, and a freckle fest under her clothes? angel kisses. how sweet, just like tenderized meat. i determined right then to propose. 
from these benchlands, we harvest the vine; rocky terrace-grown grapes do just fine. helped by mists from the river, our vineyards deliver california's most savory wine. 
has some store run a fire sale on attitude? no one's gracious these days. where's the gratitude? seems the id's in control, and it's taken its toll: self-indulgence with infinite latitude. 
all things finite, my friend, have an end. carpe diem's what i recommend. therefore play, don't delay. let yourself go astray. do it now! you've your youth to misspend. 
the elder may not look like much, but its berries perform in the clutch. and the elderflowers produce some flavorsome juice used in cordials and syrups and such. 
eradication's befitting their kind. kill them all, leave no issue behind? evil scourge of the earth, without value or worth? damned roaches! just peta will mind. 
she's beside me, but deaf to my voice. i'm not music, so ipod's her choice. if she'd pay some attention, she might hear me mention my intention to leave her for joyce. 
we speak only fine english, my dear, no bilabial fricatives here. once a spaniard appeared voicing b's that were weird, with just lips. i distrusted my ear. 
though we've argued, i'm first to relent once she's bathed?it's that blossomy scent. when her aura turns floral, my notions turn oral. what ensues leaves me calmed and content. 
newly air-conditioned gramercy park, our retreat from the heat (what a lark!): here, hermetically sealed, all the fat and well-heeled walk designer dogs. each leaves his mark. 
she's no lover of trinkets, my sal: not a gewgaw, no flashy fallal. but a plain golden band on her delicate hand says "move on and begone from me, pal." 
some wee fairy's about; i can tell, as the dairy's developed a smell. if that fabulous fay has for too long held sway, the whole larder will turn to his spell. 
it's a frankish capitulary: laws of the court, and not missing a clause! it's not charlemagne's, sadly, but we need such texts badly. we've got copies; they're riddled with flaws. 
third-class coaches are crude and subpar. we move west on our emigrant car. what's awaiting us there? well, at least we'll find air! but montana's improbably far. 
they make vicious, flagitious incursions. using threats, they're enforcing conversions. and they broadcast their actions. don't quote me; some factions have accused me of racist aspersions. 
our survival shack's primitive, crude, but we've stacked it with ambient food, an emergency hoard that will keep where it's stored, to be tapped when the world comes unglued. 
scouting bedmates: a walk in the park in the dives where the shadows are stark. but her face?does it matter? a feast fills your platter, 'cause all cats are gray in the dark. 
out of options? then act, but act now. make the one play your plight might allow. standing pat has been hell, so break out; might as well: you can't dance and it's too wet to plow. 
says her shrink, her affective disorder is "when feelings slosh over the border," when "one's mood's out of whack." her last panic attack was unnerving?the force of it floored her. 
don't go home yet?the night's not complete: there's an after-party; join me, my sweet. bring your high from the rave, clean forget to behave, and mix sweats with the showbiz elite. 
when a few sheets of paper are fused for academy board, it's then used as a surface for paint. though today it seems quaint, in the past, it had artists enthused. 
if it's published at all, it would be by an academic press, doc. you'll see. crammed with recondite knowledge, it might find a college and be read for some useless degree. 
he's despondent, bereft of desire. even troopers need fuel for the fire. a cup too damn low, he can't manage the show. he'll perk up when he's just a shot higher. 
sue's my godchild; i'll not let you date her. more prosperous prospects await her, you abbreviated piece of nothing. my niece is rebelling now; wisdom comes later. 
"the balloon glass is large, stemmed and rounded," he declared, and how pompous he sounded? then went on to disclose how it "holds the grape's nose." i held mine. i prefer to stay grounded. 
a few pizza joint tools are tangential, but my baker's peel's proven essential. repositioning pies? any type, any size, it diminishes mishap potential. 
some sausage, i find, is delicious, but the content's too often suspicious. so most bags of mystery i shun. we have history: in my gut they erupt and turn vicious. 
our treasured apothecary chest shows its age?deeply stained and distressed. in a score of wee drawers, once a chemist kept stores and devices?and one furry guest. 
my backroom boys' groundwork's a blessing. with their aid, i've been safely progressing. overworked, underpaid, too obscure to get laid, they keep probing, thank god, and obsessing. 
the blue azure stone (lapis) is duly sought after by some like yours truly. yet it's snubbed and disdained as "that rock cheaply stained? how gaudy!" they're judging it cruelly. 
you've got babies-in-the-eyes: a reflection? of whom? this bears further inspection: tiny mirrors of me to a pint-sized degree on both orbs, and with all my perfection. 
it's ghost-plagued and far from baronial: a two-hundred-year-old colonial with papers to prove it. you're forbidden to move it. any change would need god's testimonial. 
early evening's when patience grows thinner: kids are home, but it's early for dinner. dispositions turn sour; it's the arsenic hour. the first to the table's the winner. 
their amour de voyage was miscast, thought their intimates, clearly aghast. but that shipboard romance, that delectable dance, was intense and one helluva blast. 
through this valley, vast glaciers once flowed, their broad shoulders conveying a load, as you'll clearly deduce from the gravel ground loose and the boulder trains lining this road. 
use your ice axe to chop out a chunk of the glacier's blue ice to be drunk. and then melt it. it's old and delightfully cold, and purer than aquifer junk. 
once you realize black-collar trades can turn nasty, their charm quickly fades. the black market's illicit and risks are implicit, but the yield! so corruption pervades. 
he stands firm in his guard post all day, never batting an eyelid, okay? stolid stoic devotion? wait! a hint of emotion: he's batted an eyelid at faye. 
at a loss for the words? remain quiet. if she beggars description, don't try it. should a shape strike you numb, don't babble, succumb: you're smitten. why try to deny it? 
i don't breakfast. i'd rather just munch, then a nice barley sandwich for lunch. one more glass of cold beer as the evening draws near, then i eat: pickled pigs' feet and punch. 
he proposes; his girl acquiesces with a flurry of heartfelt caresses. comes a turn for the worse, as she shifts to reverse, backing water. the chump reassesses. 
of integrity pols are bereft. a damn beauty contest's all we have left. each event's neatly staged, so we've all disengaged and lost sight of who's warp and who's weft. 
"how much ammo, sarge? what's your advice?" "one banana clip-full should suffice. once the mujahideen spot that long magazine, they'll skedaddle like hairy-ass mice." 
"clean up?the first tee's in an an hour. use the ball-washer, dude?why so sour?" "i don't want to sound rude, but a ball-washer dude? makes me squeamish. i think i'll just shower." 
we've got c-rations, some fit to eat, with their tins of unspecified meat (which some claim is wombat. but hell, this is combat), and coffee and fudge. ain't that sweet! 
sitting large in the rear of this barn is our kier, used for fabric or yarn. it does bleaching or bucking (not bathing or ducking)? wait?does any of you give a darn? 
he's loud, but he ain't got the goods? all excuses, all oughttas and shoulds? brutum fulmen. the loser might bray like a bruiser, but i doubt he'd break wind in the woods. 
are you comfy?at home and relaxed? and your work load?not stressed, overtaxed? love to keep you around, and we're sure you'll rebound, but we've found you, well, shiftless. you're axed. 
"you awoke to a smoke and some joe for at least forty days in a row. that's disgusting," you say. while i feel your dismay, that's my breakfast of champions, bro. 
once again the mideast is inflamed; is an envoy extraordinary named? it's a delicate mission, no hope of fruition: certain parties will never be tamed. 
boutique farming has muddled my mind: raise alpacas, leave cattle behind? itty-bitty potatoes and ugly tomatoes? i'm confused and left dragging behind. 
nose to tail, racers roar round the track? cut the wind from up front and in back. this drafting, effective from each car's perspective, adds speed to each car in a pack. 
once we'd build things and know where stuff goes, but it's aftertimes now; no one knows. now the simplest productions have books of instructions with poor graphics and translated prose. 
on certain occasions, he barks, which of course can prompt cutesy remarks. aboiements, he's been told: beastly noise, uncontrolled. now it's gotten him barred from the parks. 
from a diner in kalamazoo: "finish up, son; kids starve in peru." "i will not clean my plate. ma, the food here ain't great; even poor kids would spew up this stew." 
elimination is ruling stuff out, like opponents or foods that cause gout. through a process thus named, apprehensions are tamed by clinicians, expungers of doubt. 
his position completely beset, he still dithers, no strategy yet: no resolve, no design. has the man got no spine? what a flaccid response to a threat! 
the camel's nose here is control: it enlarges the government's role. though the bill seems benign, enforcement by fine is a bureaucrat's ace in the hole. 
he deserves telling off, but he's scary. i know just what to do: send for mary. yes, big mary?the fat one. she's a fire-eater, that one, and ornery, loud and contrary. 
at first blush, she seems primed for romance when she turns to me fresh from her dance. still, that look proves misleading: her glow offers breeding, but her lips say, "forget it?no chance." 
you're congested, my friend; don't you see? every branch of your bronchial tree. any moment, i swear, you'll be gasping for air. call a plumber. you're clogged with debris. 
"a magnificent broken-field run," said the coach to his man. "that was fun!" "you slip right through that hole, make a streak for the goal? barely touched. the acclaim's just begun." 
for you cabbage pounders, golf can get tough. there you are again, stuck in the rough. try some dynamite, cheat, or accept your defeat, 'cause your chipping wedge won't be enough. 
this magnum holds more than old dreck says the bottle ticket hung round its neck. the small plaque on a chain, in the vintner's domain, asserts "this is a good one." i'll check. 
we'd meet up after chores and talk sin, tellin' lies, passin' time countin' kin: my two cousins in jail to your three out on bail? summer nights out behind stuckey's gin. 
under flextime, not much is taboo, though your core hours remain nine till two, when the crowds shuffle in seeking vodka or gin, and for melodies fittingly blue. 
like pineapples, figs are collective, which succeeeds from an eater's perspective: several flowers combine in a fruit, which is fine, if peculiar. god's found it effective. 
said doc dingle, a bit of a quack, "you've got years of accumulated plaque: layered crud in your butt. let's re-route your whole gut." i skedaddled and never looked back. 
use a coarse salt; its much larger grain makes its presence apparent and plain, thus avoiding deceit. it'll kosher your meat, though quite how isn't strictly germane. 
as a purist, i often resent where a climbing bolt aids the ascent, where it lures the unwary. mountaineering is hairy; these anchors were not god's intent. 
penning verse has become but a chore, yet i'll climb my parnassus once more. may, this next time, my rhyme be uniquely sublime, one apollo himself shan't ignore. 
the blue vase sold at auction in nice is a clair-de-lune porcelain piece. rather old?early qing, this so-delicate thing sold too low and will surely increase. 
i've got circular breathing to master for oboe?so far, a disaster. it's air in through the nose all the time the mouth blows. but i faint. must my nose-work be faster? 
bubba's? fine for some coffee and cake, but steer clear of their chicken-fried steak: the damn batter's rock-hard, the sauce largely lard and the "beef"?hell, it's probably snake. 
an apple worm thrives within fruit, seeking moth-hood?its stubborn pursuit. it's been found to infest several tree fruits, the pest? larval codling moths, small but not cute. 
demand cumberland sauce for your ham. honey glaze by itself is a sham. currant jelly in port with a zest of some sort? serve it chilled or it's not worth a damn. 
i got called up to major league ball? a cup of coffee with philly was all. seven days in "the show" (it's my hummer?too slow), so goodbye to my place in the hall. 
though security there was outmoded, it was filming when rover exploded. it was your crud she swallowed then the grisly stuff followed. the tape's been cued up and it's loaded. 
midst the clash of familial prides, rules of esnecy state who divides poppa's lands and all shares among all-female heirs: eldest daughter's the voice that decides. 
as we've hatched this young falcon, this eyas, his lordship, we pray, won't deny us. we shall feed it on mice (first their pups should suffice) so there's nothing to beg him to buy us. 
daily dinner here's barely alright: cowboy caviar (name's a delight)? just your basic baked beans served with nondescript greens on the side. yup, you're farting all night. 
i'm a long-term cooperator here, and board president year after year. you're a shareholder? vote! as a wise man once wrote: solidarity conquers our fear. 
our converted rice, steamed and then dried, is by purists unjustly decried: it's nature subverted, they'd have us alerted. but the best part's just driven inside. 
maxwell's sculptured, hard-working and tanned, but his core asset's sought-after land. so he husbands it well: always lease, never sell, and since woodstock all concerts are banned. 
the old nag ain't caught on to it yet, and thank god, 'cause i'll never forget those gymnastically hot, lovely days on the yacht? dirty weekends with bouncing babette. 
the sun, gone for a while, is unbowed, as his rays still escape through the cloud. devil's smiles these are named, as the beast's yet untamed. heaven frowns, some say. lucifer's proud. 
we've got fine campus eateries, but the old dairy bar's closed?funding cut. i'll miss "omelet supreme" and their fresh-made ice cream. well, there's always the burger joint glut. 
there's design bedding up on her hill, and (how clever) the blossoms spell bill. her devotion's thus seen on a carpet of green? hope the interstate hordes get a thrill. 
she had driven her ducks, it was said, to a mighty poor market instead of her marrying well. she'd been living in hell till she butchered the bully in bed. 
i'd dispose of some verbs if i could. they refuse to behave as they should. the verb can is defective from a usage perspective: missing parts in a verb can't be good. 
with enthusiasms vast as the sky, he's a deep-dish, intense sort of guy, not a hint of discretion; each like's an obsession. his lusts have him endlessly high. 
at court, the defendant appeared in a deely-bobber notably weird: from her headband sprung eyes of remarkable size bouncing wildly. the gallery cheered. 
hang your shit on my ape hangers, honey: custom handlebars, well worth the money. extra high, extra wide, they look hot on my ride, and ain't nobody'd dare call them "funny." 
he's below the proverbial salt. though he's lowly, it isn't his fault. still, he takes to your daughter like a duck does to water. put a stop to it, jack. call a halt. 
can't hang ten on your waxy-assed board? get a grip, man; you're out of your gourd. add some deck grips, i mean; you might just make eighteen. a wipe-out's not pretty. good lord! 
a geologist's learned conclusions: "that's country rock laced with intrusions. younger igneous dikes mimic backbones or spikes in the wall rock, like molten transfusions." 
queued for days in the same damn position? first to own is a dumb competition. even i, an obsessive, find the dwell time oppressive. but quit? i'd be hanged for sedition. 
that he's sober for months says a lot, but he can't kick the life of a sot: he's disorganized, glum. who knows what will become of that dry drunk? the man's lost the plot. 
the ojibwe knew something of sleep, of its demons, which gnaw at you, deep. certain magical things of odd feathers and strings served as dream-catchers. mine's earned its keep. 
the king's heir, at long last, has been found, introduced to his subjects and crowned. now he's rolled up his sleeves and is weeding out thieves. we are satisfied down to the ground. 
my brother and i had a pact: with two sisters we'd each "do the act." well, we married the pair? tied the knots fair and square. double cousins came after the fact. 
i shan't disaccommodate thee; thy convenience means all things to me, prithee lie thee beside me, as i, a new bride, am convenient as any could be. 
we've got handles and hinges and locks that'll knock you right out of your socks. keep your brass-work from drawers; we dismantle old doors. resurrected door furniture rocks. 
i read palms (and a girl could do worse). here on yours there's a hint of a curse. hon, what have you been kissing; your heart line's gone missing: not a trace of your distal transverse. 
our old home is now empty, a shell. it was pop's express wish that we sell. there's no doubt we'll all miss it, but the will is explicit: "dump the dump, kids; it's started to smell." 
they look luscious placed there on the table: dessert grapes, or so reads the label. though wine grapes are sweeter, these, seedless, are neater. as to hue, grapes range sunny to sable. 
the emergent year after bc was the crossover time to ad. there are many such years? days when something premieres, so our calendars may not agree. 
i keep searching the sweetest sweet shops for my favorite raspberry drops. sucking candy's my vice (at a sensible price)? not godiva, but give 'em their props. 
tonight's firefight was daunting but brief: lots of noise, but, thank god, little grief. end results? inconclusive. implications elusive. while it raged, though, i shook like a leaf. 
as charon the ferryman's fee, here's a penny. it's some guarantee he'll convey you across. that old boatman's the boss on the styx; his approval is key. 
that's your cover, recruit, not your "hat," as your weapon is never your "gat." a marine's in the game once he's learned a thing's name. a damn hat's for a doctor seuss cat. 
during evals, we're nothing but smiles: the boss is reviewing our files. we're respectful and sweet, with all projects complete. she asks, "problems?" a suite of denials. 
when you're forced to take meals on the fly, have cupholder cuisine standing by. while you're driving, it's there; scarf it down, say a prayer. give convenience that old college try. 
"i've got answers," chuck chortles with glee, "and all cribbed from the monitor's key." that's a pretty fine source, so we jump chuck, of course. i've got answers?yes, wily old me. 
row on row, in the dark, sit the hordes, while these footlights illumine my boards. all those eyes scan my face in this magical place. the attention's the best of awards. 
broadway's glamor is hard to deny; in the footlights, you're some other guy. picture me on the boards: adoration, awards. so i contemplate callbacks? and sigh. 
there's rage in each well-chosen word; every syllable sings to the herd. she's fomenting rebellion and bedlam, that hellion. can't ignore her?the bitch will be heard. 
in the twenties, aunt lulu loved dancing, short dresses, bobbed hair and romancing: life was sweet for this flapper. now, lulu's a napper, at peace as old time is advancing. 
your lab tech's intense, overwrought, but his data's indeed food for thought. still, if after review, it proves out, we can skew it our way, or our work's gone for naught. 
self-employed, uninsured, you get whacked. it's defined as a "fineable act," so the tax goons grab more. move your business offshore, 'cause you can't beat the odds here; they're stacked. 
nab the varmints; let none get away. jean's a genius with cockroach flamb?. they're first bathed in fine brandy (which, of course, jean keeps handy), presented, ignited. ol?! 
that fakir is an obvious faker? a three-dollar bill like jim bakker, who'll perform for the bucks of the commonplace clucks. hail to humbug, a sure profit maker. 
port propeller's beginning to stutter; we can feather the blades, not just shut her. that'll level the pitch so we won't need to ditch. on one prop, we'll fly smooth as warm butter. 
in a prison escape, it adds glamour when a gunfighter's fanning his hammer. with the trigger removed, speed of firing's improved. (how'd that handgun get into the slammer?) 
detailed planning just leads to frustrations. when i move, it's without preparations. to fly by the seat of your pants can't be beat: it routinely defeats expectations. 
although twitter's been taken by storm, smiley's acts were in rather poor form: half-nude video stunts that went viral at once 'cause they fly in the face of the norm. 
she'd done well in a lucrative sphere, but my daughter has dumped her career. she's now one of those crazies distributing daisies? a flower child and happy? i hear. 
that old teamster won't get any thinner feeding daily on bowls of boiled dinner. still, at least it's complete? all those veggies and meat, and at meals, he's one damned hungry skinner. 
patience pays; she's at last hit the mark: found a man with a floor-through on park (the whole thirty-third story). now she basks in her glory, content?what a life, what a lark. 
that crew out at state are the groggiest wonks in d.c., and the soggiest? fried before four, unaware we're at war. folks at foggy bottom haven't the foggiest. 
she embodied my every desire, her flip-flops her only attire? barely shielding her feet from the sand's summer heat. i stayed cool but my loins were on fire. 
there's something this fireplace is lacking: ornamental and functional backing, like a fire-back of steel. it would also conceal the old stonework that's visibly cracking. 
these abuses she's merely inferred: all constructive, despite how we're stirred. "my old man was abusive," she swears. proof's elusive of a memory that never occurred. 
"ballerinas must own first position" was our tutor's routine admonition, "stand as light as a feather, toes apart, heels together." (who'd do that of her own damned volition?) 
his false piety's easy to see. he's a hypocrite, human debris. his acts? sanctimonious? not vile and felonious. we all feign to a certain degree. 
wait a moment. i've got a suspicion that this volume's a true first edition of tartuffe, worth a mint? the play's first time in print. what a find! it's my lifetime ambition. 
you're the worst of your outfit, hands down, a damned malcontent, false to the crown. so it's "rogue's march" for you, no more stirring tattoo. face the music and get out of town. 
it's all over; relax awhile now. let this eye pillow rest on your brow. it will block the harsh light with a pressure just right. you need soothing?the eye pillow's how. 
downtown phoenix, a hot summer's day: august's torrid inertia holds sway. a large flash mob assembles dons gear that resembles banditos', then stages a play. 
convince karen (she's trendy and cute), and her classmates will soon follow suit. an exemplar of style to the school's rank and file, she's a leader, and wealthy to boot. 
though she's gifted beyond all compare, and no doubt we're a hell of a pair, to my great disappointment, there's a fly in the ointment: her size. there's so much of her there! 
this faberg? egg was bedecked and begemmed for the rich and select? for the czar's own czarina or a first ballerina. so give the old tchotchke respect. 
gilded feathers bedizen the hat on his wrinkle-assed, fur-challenged cat. and his ermine-lined tux? liberace redux! man, how freaking flamboyant is that? 
"you look shot!" "i'm a mighty tired feller." "use my foldaway bed in the cellar." "gotta hide from the wife. she's the soul of my life, and a beaut, but at times she's a heller." 
they serve duchess potatoes; that's rare. they're a bit of a pain to prepare: mashed, shaped, seasoned and baked (not a step can be faked) golden brown?quite a treat if you dare. 
are you down on your uppers of late? is your piggy bank way underweight? are you penniless, dragging? (forgive me my nagging.) still, there's hope for a lad of but eight. 
just a flare-up, that's all?send a nurse. stop your keening; it's making it worse. it's recurrent malaria, so hold the hysteria. which of my wives sent the hearse? 
an evocative feast for the eyes shimmers temptingly, west of that rise. once again i feel conned. it's another false pond, a mirage that reflects empty skies. 
a foreign body invaded my eye? something nasty that plunged from the sky. and it feels like a boulder shut down my beholder. i'm impaired, doc. i can't even cry. 
does  the earth have four corners? i doubt it. but it's vast, and make no doubt about it. an inveterate rover, i've scoured the world over. had i found them, by golly i'd shout it. 
we'd return from our daily patrols to cold joe and a bowlful of holes. they were donut holes, true, and we'd pop quite a few. the fried dough seemed to bolster our souls. 
the uk as we've known it is through. sound the trumpets or blow the kazoo? the p.m. and his minions shared valid opinions, but who's driven by downing street's view? 
do your print-outs continue for miles? then de-dupe all identical files (although one should survive once you've cleaned out your drive). dump those doubles?your harvest is smiles. 
we produced till the night of the quake. shutting down then, we made a clean  break. to persist was no use? force majeure our excuse. the land shrugs; little's left in its wake. 
the arri?re-garde is my soi-disant clique. nothing trendy's for me?nothing chic. social media? why? i'm a d?mod? guy who buys clothes at the bygones boutique. 
first groundwork, then selling the "suits," next production?it's time for first fruits. once promotions begin, we'll start raking it in. every tween will need sandal-top boots. 
with his choice of establishing shot, a director advances his plot. then, intrigued or enraptured, the viewers are captured: drawn in, as if there, on the spot. 
i'm not asking devotion of you, just some tender caressing would do. i'm in need of repair: rub my back, stroke my hair, then a cuddle. i'm sure i'll pull through. 
your light touch sets my consciousness free? bless?d bliss in the highest degree, all my nerve endings thrumming. don't stop, keep it coming. my darling, you ecstasize me. 
it's been said i'm a failure at chess. these canards, here and now, i address: certain sweet recollections, perfervid reflections, have merely deferred my success. 
the book's special, but take my advice: it's got foxing, so lower your price. water spots are a drag, an unfortunate snag. may i ask why you've kept it on ice? 
from the spider web's outermost line, its foundation, depends its design. and though this line's not sticky, to me, they're all icky. walk through? i politely decline. 
the burn bag's a sensitive thing for us wonks in the covert west wing. if a document leaks (isn't torched), some poor geek's up the creek with his ass in a sling. 
there's fore-and-aft rig on my yawl, so she'll handle quite well in a squall. full of wind she's unreal, sails aligned with her keel. we cast off, mate, in no time at all. 
he's no fantail; his sparse-feathered rear is prosaic. i see that from here. a mere working-class pigeon, he struts with a smidgen of pride, and coos with a sneer. 
for endurance, it's denim, a twill, or a somewhat less chic cotton drill. demand leg wear and sleeves made of plain, trusty weaves from an old and dependable mill. 
flaming flambeaux illumine the way to the high-level talks held today. "look, they mirror the fervor, the rage," an observer opines, "with their heated display." 
he's played pranks since before he turned twenty, bending boundaries?a true cognoscente of the spirited scrape and the hairs-breadth escape. he's had escapades, bless him, aplenty. 
the disease erupts quickly, i fear: exanthematous outbreaks appear, and all over the place, from the trunk to the face. my prognosis: three weeks till you're clear. 
their delaying stunts are a concern. without movement, our plans crash and burn. but the act won't be stalled if the question is called? right now! before long we adjourn. 
this epiphenomenon, itching, comes along with perpetual twitching. professionally speaking, your body?it's freaking. your ex, i dare say, was bewitching? 
jelly doughnut?? they fancy berliner, or bismarck, and theirs is a winner. with blackberry filling it merits top billing. i ate five. what the hell, i'm a sinner. 
meet our venus de milo. "i'm charmed." lovely now as before she was harmed ? yes, dismembered, but still hardly run-of-the-mill; she might wave, but she's, sadly, disarmed. 
we facilitators always precede him, recruit toadies to cosset and feed him. ergo, where he goes, we go and fatten his ego. he's certain the multitudes need him. 
our recruits here are all warmly greeted, then screenings are fairly completed. once positions are filled, all the rest will be killed. until then, you'll be equitably treated. 
i'd been courtin' my wee bonny cummer on a brae in the warm of midsummer. "dinnae dae that," she cried. when for seconds i tried, "wanty bolt!" then she fled. what a bummer. 
an elucidative story she told served to clarify reasons to fold: in the same situation, we'd be wrecked by inflation, out of business and out in the cold. 
she's fourteen and my baby's abloom, the sweet focus of all in the room, and it's making me queasy. thirteen seemed so easy! one year?baby's lowered the boom. 
the fourteenth, two weeks deep in july: revolution! the world's gone awry. masses storm the bastille. can la france ever heal? "libert?" is the loudest reply. 
i've lived this damn lush life for days. i expense it; the company pays. still, i'm forced to dine well in the firm's choice hotel with my clients. this merits a raise. 
i advanced through the field of damp rye with my shotgun, my fowling piece by. the morning was hushed till a fine bird was flushed with a clatter, and made for the sky. 
we remember dick fosbury's flop in the high jump. dick came out on top. the technique is still hot, so a flop it was not. once, i tried it?let's please let that drop. 
a felling crew harvesting trees needs a boss man, a bull, if you please. i'm that bull of the woods, but my men?damaged goods: wretched refuse with rap sheets and fleas. 
i'm an answer-jobber working for ask. it's a thankless and ill-paying task. i field questions from nerds about bird-eating birds with a constant companion: my flask. 
this demolitionist's work is top drawer. pounding pavements, he sells door to door. he turns structures to rubble and gets paid for his trouble. yep, business is booming, for sure. 
clearly weak since he gained his position, his tenure's defined by omission. both clueless and reckless, he's certainly feckless. his words have lost all definition. 
only kitsch is on sale in this store: early battersea?gaudy decor. overwrought and obtrusive, its allure is elusive. they have everything here i deplore. 
in the delta, our granular clay is called buckshot. it tends to be gray. when it's wet, it's right sticky, but rich, so who's picky? i'd choose buckshot to farm any day. 
she's a beauty, this filly i chose, with a bald from her ears to her nose, christened "blanca," of course, my swift apron-faced horse. are there roses in store? no one knows. 
a top foxhound must run without flagging. our whole pack has that knack (i'm not bragging). need hunters with bottom? our kennel has got 'em. they'll finish the chase, tails a-wagging. 
drag my coaster uphill by a rope, then i belly-flop, prone, down the slope. and that's me! kid on fire, on my flexible flyer. for a boy, snow's the true great white hope. 
big decision?i must reappraise; ambitendencies tug me both ways. i'm aware it's my call, but i'd rather just stall: i've played hooky from work these eight days. 
my old watch?in a fob's where i dock it on my vest or my trouser's watch pocket. or a fob is its chain (language drives me insane), a medallion, a ribbon or locket. 
we attacked; they were doubtless delighted. their guns were formidably sited? their position so strong that we didn't last long, but the colonel survived? and was knighted. 
we've been too long denied and deprived; we'll unseat the already arrived, who of late have been slipping, their images chipping? and we lurk, expectations revived. 
how foolish we were, how na?ve, how absurdly prepared to believe, always primed to be taken! too late we'd awaken from dreams we would never retrieve. 
not much sunbathing's done around here where we're fogbound for most of the year, where our green, misty marsh makes the sunshine seem harsh on rare days when it deigns to appear. 
at the oil field, the driller's been crowing, "discovery well's up and flowing, all my trials reversed, and it's only the first. what's that smell? that's my bank account growing." 
i've never made much, but i'll try. stella's growing our baby; that's why. all i know is brute force; look, i'm strong like a horse. i can lift heavy things. we'll get by. 
we're all nuts, so we'll all persevere in this queue for a star trek premiere. ah, but somewhere out there is a flick, we'll all swear, worth a wait of a full cosmic year. 
"cash or plastic, sir?stop taking on. no one's said you've attempted a con. by the time a check's bounced," the owner pronounced, "both food and consumer are gone." 
he'll pass and leave gas in his wake. he's all mouth and no trousers, the fake. he's the lord of inaction, a babbling abstraction? god's blusterous, feckless mistake. 
the allrightniks found riverside drive and moved in; now the district's alive. uptown heights sure appealed to the lately well-heeled: you can thrive when, at last, you arrive. 
my publicists, frogbottom-fink, got me eight column inches of ink. without this attention, this newspaper mention, i'd sink. lord, i shudder to think? 
practice well to stay still as a mouse if you'd bag a fat pheasant or grouse. going fowling, we share a fine hunt in fresh air. grab your gun and get out of the house. 
that your cabin would soon fall asunder was foreseeable, friend, and no wonder. you'd been warned your new digs needed brickwork, not twigs, so it failed at the first crash of thunder. 
absolution? pray say that's untrue. don't forgive them; they know what they do. man is weak. all the same, don't deny him the blame he's achieved. give the devil his due. 
a guy's driving; a boneyard rolls by in the background. we all suspect why. such foreshadowing tip-offs and hints are just rip-offs. surprise us; cheap gimmicks won't fly. 
the usual deadbeats appear as the annual banquet draws near. they'll find foodstuffs galore (keeps the wolf from the door). greed is good?if just once in a year. 
there's a gap between high and low tide where some prey and their hunters collide. here, from killdeer and plover the sand crab seeks cover. but the foreshore's a poor place to hide. 
in this dusty antique shop display a rare brooch made by carl faberg? bears no price, yet it's priceless. i'm nice, but not vice-less. for a song, i can take it away. 
"let's go leaf hunting," dad used to say, "to the back roads for autumn's display!" to miss foliage season was to dad worse than treason: miss the pies and fresh cider? no way! 
when an earthquake takes place underground, straight above's where its epicenter's found. often wreckage here's shattering? at times, just a smattering. earth's crust conducts shock waves around. 
lousy case?help the jurors see through it. his alibi: go and pursue it. but his mom they won't buy. an ex-girlfriend might fly? one exculpatory witness should do it. 
the new structure's a glorified gym. it's a field house, according to him. he's the coach, and he's cocky, his mindset, well, jock-y. contradict him? results could be grim. 
uncle's mind is commencing to shrink; what it's up to i shudder to think. it's bewildered, befuddled, increasingly muddled, and cobwebbed by dotage and drink. 
the decision came down from on high: tried for espionage, hanged for a spy. while the amnesty nuts climbed all over our butts, others queued up to watch the worm die. 
charged with felicide, killing a cat, i'm now spurned like a neighborhood rat. i'm confused; they should try it. they're all on a diet, and braised pussy is very low fat. 
every sunday was quite exegetic. reverend's preachings were always magnetic. whatever it took, he'd unravel the book, using language intense and frenetic. 
we expect to fetch boston by noon, and her harbor's no balmy lagoon, yet i'll not again roam quite so distant from home. this last sail can't be over too soon. 
felicific appeals promise pleasure, and are tempting beyond any measure. would you draw the mob in? try suggestions of sin, then abuse the damn rubes at your leisure. 
he's collapsed, and can't budge?not a fraction, cataplectic defines the reaction. he's just seen her. it's her! she's come back; he can't stir? till a part of him springs into action. 
this cuisine's not for me; it's the pits: filled with sharp-tasting, bitterish bits of radicchio, kale? sides of rhubarb-grilled snail? not to mention arugula grits. 
there are biotite flakes in this schist. nature's added this black mica twist. though its name's not well known, schist's a commonplace stone with panache. it will not be dismissed. 
for each bridesmaid, a gift with a twist: precious dorothy bags (hung from the wrist) with fresh petals to strew. but please say it's untrue that each petal's a guy the bride's "kissed." 
forensics employs information solving crimes or to aid litigation: detectives use science or attorneys back clients first with facts, then a cogent summation. 
today's warmth was a foretaste of spring (think azaleas and birds on the wing). no stravinsky ballet? a mere soup?on of may? summer's just thrown her hat in the ring. 
naked mole rats' fossorial ways, well adapted to dry afric days, put them well underground where by nature they're found, kept away from the sun's brutal rays. 
though this novel's familiar, i'm sure it's just published: fresh in at the store. i suppose it's some kind of bizarre sleight of mind. d?j? lu hurts my brain. please, no more. 
do you yearn for the touch of her skin? there's a formulary gathered herein that, when cunningly plied won't be lightly denied. this book's magic will make her head spin. 
these are dead walls: no windows, no doors. from your room's point of view, they lack pores. for a wall's like a skin, keeping stuff out or in as it segregates ceilings from floors. 
days like this must be cryovacked: kept, then revived by some godlike adept. such sweet moments, once chosen, should be shrink-wrapped then frozen. then, ennui we might better accept. 
hate to tell you this, pops: you've been fleeced no damn way was that joker a priest! and your "wheels for the poor" are already offshore, somewhere palms are kept liberally greased. 
on the prairie, boudin was a treat: roasted buff gut instead of mere meat. while the cook worked at stuffing it, by the fire we'd sit, roughing it. before long, "the white pudding's complete." 
my book's dying, but wins a few prizes and a flurry of interest arises with winings and dinings, re-releases and signings. my hat size expands a few sizes. 
once they posted me here, i was screwed: just a month and i'm coming unglued. the rare squeaks of dissent here match the dull, gray cement here. local eidos? plebeian and crude. 
spend the night with this sculptured physique; call me "oscar," a star at his peak. not for certain?not yet? but that nude statuette will be mine. shooting opens next week. 
set the baby aside a sec, sweet. she's devouring my favorite treat. cutely packaged, nutritious colostrum's delicious. without foremilk, this day's not complete. 
i get languid by ten, and it shows. "douse the glim, dear; you're starting to doze," says my darling most nights. so i reach for the lights. i need prompting these days, i suppose. 
where the piedmont rolls down to the plain, the conspicuous change in terrain is the fall line. its power mills lumber or flour. build there, and cease racking your brain. 
ranks of snare drums command the parade (such intensity must be obeyed), their batter heads battered till serenity's shattered. are there lands near-at-hand to invade? 
i beg your forgiveness, my dear; i've got news you would rather not hear: your skirt's caught in your knickers (which explains all the snickers). from where i sit, your assets are clear. 
is a fire breaking out? no excuses: handy chamber pots have other uses. there's one under your bed. so be calm, use your head, and be thankful for bodily juices. 
all those accolades showered on spiro for a deed that amounted to zero? a few finger pads burned? all the praise was unearned. think again before calling him "hero." 
she's revealing far more of her past, perhaps parting her curtains too fast. though thoughts dark and forbidden might more safely stay hidden, she's more forthcoming this week than last. 
the boards creak, and at first we deduce that the flooring's installed to be loose. thus intruders are thwarted, assaults are aborted? or perhaps that's a floorer's excuse. 
all is calm, but fall weather deceives: gusts rise swiftly and flurry the leaves. where they'd lolled about mildly, they're dervishing wildly. they'll wind up in my hedges and eaves. 
this camembert's not merely old; it's gone floccose with patches of mold. it smells tempting?it does, but those lumps of green fuzz put me off, and i'm not feeling bold. 
are floor lamps for visiting moles? no, they're light sources mounted on poles. from behind my own chair, one illumines my hair as i read (and protects me from trolls). 
today's author would look down her nose at john lyly's too-flowery prose: elaborate, ornate and a bitch to create? an achievement, as far as that goes. 
if contemplative man seeks retreat in his fly fishing, that's not defeat. luring trout with fake bugs won't replace a wife's hugs, but rewards are divinely concrete. 
that she suffered the fate that you feared was a fluke?unpredictably weird. you could never have known that she'd choke on calzone. looking back, though, we shouldn't have jeered. 
here's that new esoteric anthology called fluvial geomorphology: the impact of rivers on the land. it delivers too well?too complex and, um, college-y. 
the first snowfall this year's no great shakes? just a flurry is all, a few flakes. though it's gently delightful, it can blossom to frightful. i think this year i'm pulling up stakes. 
i glimpsed fleetingly, down by the pond, a rare tropicbird blown from beyond. confirmation's proved iffy (it was gone in a jiffy), but this birdwatcher's never been conned. 
apparatus arriving today on two flatbeds was trucked from green bay. though it's massive, impressive (the freight rates excessive), installed, it will pay its own way. 
special flatware for soup and dessert? he's flat flustered, the poor little squirt! and this curious chork: it's half chopsticks, half fork. basic eating irons, please?would it hurt? 
yes, i've met her. my take? unimpressive. her scent's, shall we say, too aggressive: not subtle, it's flagrant? overweeningly fragrant. keep searching. she's coarse and excessive. 
send for suzy. i'm sure she'll be there. she'll distract them; that doll has a flair; a genuine knack to take just the right tack. watch: she'll enter the bank and strip bare. 
watch the moth; it's enkindled in flame: burnt to ash. yes, temptation trumps shame. destruction has charms when seduction disarms. gird your loins, son, or don't play the game. 
my corner chair's backed on two sides, so my poses respond to its guides: turn the mob a cold shoulder, glare boldly and smolder, or alter my act, like the tides. 
sitting idly, just going to seed, that flaneur's not at all what we need. are his circuits all tired? someone get him rewired! pass the pasta; the bum's off his feed. 
it's a flame war we're waging on-line via e-mail: he jeers; i opine. no one's wounded as such; we're just keeping in touch. modern warfare's damned tough to define. 
"someone's taken your bacon? that's rich." "yes, and sadly, he's filched my last flitch: a whole side of cured ham? now it's breakfasts with spam!" "a solution that's clearly last ditch." 
years of practice?i'm finally there. i'm the oboe installed at first chair. the entire woodwind section gently stamped my selection. my first solo's tonight; say a prayer. 
a fine bierock's got nice flaky crust, but its filling's what makes it robust. one or two's a a whole meal with that oma appeal. it's home cooking with stuff you can trust. 
she loves shellfish, from first to last course, longs for lobsters the size of a horse. but it's finfish for him, true fish hooked on the swim? incompatible: grounds for divorce. 
the election's no longer in doubt. the results slowly filtering out show the numbers are dire. it's gone down to the wire, but our kingfish has fought his last bout. 
added games are more tiresome than clever. now the series is lasting forever. this fall classic's just ending and snow is impending. frozen baseball's a foolish endeavor. 
in our shanty towns strewn with debris, we've no plumbing, high tea or tv. in favelas in rio, we still live con brio. we've got samba and sex, and we're free. 
he deserved it, that's not even moot? risked his life for his share of the loot. yet the man had his foes, and a firestorm arose: a rancorous, nasty dispute. 
aspetta, my friend?not your fault, but that powder in there isn't salt. could be flour or meal dusted over the veal; it's a dredger, and we're using malt. 
empty words help us say stuff okay. yet they carry no meaning per se. an infinitive's to must be granted its due. don't be rash and just toss it away. 
he seems capitally clever to me? yes, admirably. some don't agree. there are many bad actors among these detractors who'd deny what a blind chap would see. 
my meat's overcooked and too dry, but the chophouse provides a supply? tasty dope in a boat helps it slide down my throat? the best pork gravy money can buy. 
i'm for barefoot tomfoolery, bud; let's go beating our feet in the mud. when my world starts to suck, i wade in, run amok in the rich estuarial crud. 
the old souk stirred romantic reflections; scents assailed me from several directions. this brought flashbacks of home, then an evening in rome: unexpected evoked recollections. 
she's embarrassed; it's that sort of smile: it's the dry grins?won't last but a while. see? she grins with chagrin: lips rolled back, tight and thin. feeling awkward is cramping her style. 
for a finder's fee, i'll book your hall, and your caterer, waitstaff and all. when a wedding's in store, there are pitfalls galore. hire my wisdom; i won't drop the ball. 
as firestone copes with the flame, resolutely, she brushes off blame. both are numb and disdainful to what most would find painful. hard as hearthstone, her heart's known no shame. 
blooms with fimbriate petals i'll mention, like those of the dainty fringed gentian, or the scallop-edge pink, whose name's not what you'd think: ponder shears; have i grabbed your attention? 
these damned price hikes had better soon stop; i've just financed this six-pack of pop. and the banker (the louse) slapped a lien on my house. the transaction still sticks in my crop. 
get some gumption, you feather-legged wimp. your opponent's a wasted old gimp. hell, you begged for this bout; now you want to back out? (i should never have managed a chimp!) 
call them fingerlings, fry?what you wish, sold as whitebait, they're juvenile fish. once you've got a nice haul, eat 'em whole, scales and all, 'cause they're locally banned as a dish. 
this arrow is tipped with a blunt, made for bull's-eyes but crap for the hunt. dullish points fill the bill when your point's not to kill. if it broadsides a moose, he'll just grunt. 
"on my flintlock, the frizzen came loose due to careless and frequent misuse, so the cock missed its mark and there wasn't a spark," said the soldier. i bought his excuse. 
do the hem so the stitching's unseen. use a blind stitch; it must appear clean. she rends garments to shreds if she spots any threads. the old harridan's ever so mean! 
if the concept of foreordination means it's pointless to strive for salvation, destination pre-charted, each lately departed, prayers aside, may descend to damnation. 
though she's private, her countenance speaks. it's the flushing, the pink in her cheeks? some warmth, some emotion, some scandalous notion? all three? she's been wacky for weeks. 
when i open this volume, i see, on the flyleaf, "see page 33." "someone's messed with this text," i think. "bookworms? what's next? has a bookworm been messaging me?" 
at witty retorts, he's the best: i'm "the cracker who conquered the west." but tonight, he just floundered, his follow-up foundered. "back at you" had no one impressed. 
what a prize you are?state of the art, rare and sweet as a raspberry tart. your fair features torment me?with marzipan scent. bella coelia, you're breaking my heart. 
don't ignore that smug bullyboy's taunting. let him scar you; your look will be daunting. has some monocled goon drawn his saber? a boon! certain wounds should be welcomed? for flaunting. 
where you fell there was rubble. come, come: we'll minutely examine your bum. perhaps flinders of glass, flakes and shards from the grass, need removal. lie still and? oh, yum! 
two old hobos out riding the rails on the rock island line to versailles, having hopped an express, found a deal of distress: that fast rattler restructured their tails. 
my old decorative sheet music stand doesn't fit with my new baby grand. carved in odd arabesques, this cherrywood desk's now on ebay, and much in demand. 
as a method of knotting my tie, i choose four-in-hand?simple, that's why. chuck your eighty-five ways to do neckwear displays.  i'm an all-of-my-days "schoolboy" guy. 
it's the work of medieval deceivers, but this feretory still has believers who revere (or adore) skin of jesus: his foreskin. but the relic's a toe? and a beaver's. 
one more floater's been pulled from the lake. lord, how many more deaths will it take for the feud to conclude? with each corpse it's renewed, and with this mob, pride's always at stake. 
the skilled aide of tonight's featured stripper's her sea lion?deft with its flippers. with sodden solemnity. it wields each extremity, improbably nimble with zippers. 
retro pinball's a game for the chipper, fiercely focused and deft at the flipper: that ball-slinging flinger set loose by a finger. and since tommy, the knack's grown much hipper. 
dee's flirtatious? no problem for me. i've glimpsed software she's letting me see. and that brush of warm thigh as she eased slowly by made my temperature jump a degree. 
sure, i've met you before?that's a fact? in the crush room before the last act of that oscar wilde farce once the crowd had grown sparse. though it's years, gray, your looks are intact. 
as the roof of our home's overhauled, new steel flashing is being installed where the vent pipe comes through. it's the right thing to do to thwart leaks (now you know what it's called). 
we meet weekly?old coots in cahoots? for the glory of fleshly pursuits: the lost splendors of sex. in less carnal respects we're as tough as our best leather boots. 
the candidate's plainly a hunk, but his speech was a whole lot of bunk: introduction to summary, puffed full of flummery, shallow and hollow?pure junk. 
your ode to the glories of gas is too floridly worded to pass? too baroque and high-flown for your nether cologne, yet your structure and rhyme are first class. 
the foul names by which sarah'd been called understandably had her appalled. she remained unconsoled till revenge was served cold, then threw open the floodgates and bawled. 
we were "fear merchants," walking the floor. but our fears have now come to the fore: the mid-eastern black hole, spinning out of control, is too pivotal now to ignore. 
deep in carlsbad, the dripstone's fantastic; what feels rigid looks somehow elastic: huge stalagmites and drapes? one just stands there and gapes at formations both supple and plastic. 
though your offering rings a bit strange, we're still flexible, subject to change. though both ailing and faded, we might be persuaded to spring for a home on the range. 
fuzzy floccules polluting the lake mean the plant site's a sorry mistake. unforeseen or intended, whatever's suspended must be ended?and quick?for god's sake. 
my odd expletives? strictly offhand. on the spot, though, the boss yelled, "you're canned!" am i bad off? not too: see, i'm planning to sue. it's tourette's; i'll accept eighty grand. 
an item that's commonly seen as an air fern is really marine: sertularia, sea fir, (no kin to the tree fir), is sold dyed (temporarily) green. 
a foliar blight has attacked my farm's fescue, but not the whole tract: infestation is spotty, but the sick leaves look grotty? rotten harvest this year. that's a fact. 
you're a rigorous rogue, it would seem, with your loan stipulations extreme. an escape clause built in, insists, "take only skin." that pact may be hard to redeem. 
a wedding's a formal affair, then formalities done, you're a pair. after customs and rites come delectable nights. but it's binding, so "buyer beware!" 
you're irreverent! show some decorum. nobel laureates speak at this forum. you're all flippancy, sass? a damned pain in the ass, and a board member short of a quorum. 
that there heifer's as thin as a rail. flesh her out till her bulk's off the scale. fatted bovine allure ain't quite right for couture, but at auction it's not known to fail. 
even pigeons eat, drink and seem merry, but a fairy swallow swallow a fairy? yet its slick fancy dress gives me pause, i confess. i say, "tinkerbell, better be wary." 
once you spoke, the world rose to applaud. then those photos with harold and maude: naked romps in the rain can be hard to explain. campaign's over; your image is flawed 
a flight of fancy, "imagine," the song, is absurd: the whole world gets along? no religion, no war, nothing's worth fighting for. how dull! i imagine it's wrong. 
reaching out for extended control, we've now broadened our corporate goal, staffing outposts in lhasa, la paz and mombasa. we intend to grow grander than dole. 
some claim blackberry's ease and cachet made it flavor of the month in its day. but its platform, once gold, would quite quickly grow old, overwhelmed by the apple bouquet. 
so the herbalist won't be confused, certain plants' names suggest how they're used. but the feverfew treats migraine headaches. (it beats eating bloodworms, so be not amused.) 
rolling forward, our progress is slowed by the bumps in this farm-to-market road. heading west out of fargo, old nitro's our cargo? next jounce and the crap might explode. 
get political: canvass, endorse. but be prudent; don't bet the wrong horse. if his wife should discover your guy with a lover, you'll wish you could change in midcourse. 
we all thought them a helluva team till they crashed with a shared primal scream. now of course they're divorced, with all intercourse forced? oddly labored, like swimming upstream. 
the enactors of all of our laws? largely lawyers! ? which should give us pause. many bills they ordain, both verbose and arcane, are found wanting? and porous as gauze. 
is suffering something to savor? each adversity adding a flavor? some aspect, some face for our art to embrace? those who nail it earn critical favor. 
here barrow pits follow the road, dug to drain the route's pluvial load. in this herbal frontier, plant invaders appear, and, of course, the occasional toad. 
such a bird in the air would seem odd, but the ostrich is flightless?thank god! just imagine the turd- splattered noggins?absurd and repulsive. please spare me that wad. 
"southeast asian cuisine," read the sign? "perfect banh mi of stellar design." as a vietnamese hero, its grit level's zero. as a bite, though, at lunch it's divine. 
typographical choices invite disagreements, but seldom a fight: where to number the pages? don't send for the sages. foliation's top left and top right. 
this investing environment's hairy, with fluctuating prices?it's scary. values rise then revert. you could lose your fool shirt. we're like colliers without a canary. 
sales are sluggish, but i have a feeling that focus groups might be revealing. is the affluent boomer our ideal consumer? or will pensioners find us appealing? 
the fieldfare's a lackluster thrush, not the fowl to make birdwatchers gush. when this songbird rejoices, his boisterous voice is the rowdiest call in the brush. 
though his treasure, his daughter, is grown, old mcginty's as flinty as stone, and so set in his ways that not pleadings or praise will convince him. best leave her alone. 
dear god, it's been pouring for weeks. our rich farmland's run off in the creeks. and forget the big muddy, all drumly and cruddy. we're weary of turning our cheeks. 
has she thrown the bum out? no, instead she's accepted him back in her bed. he deserves her defiance, but gets her compliance: condonation. she'll wish she were dead. 
flown-in veggies? i leave them alone. give me produce that's locally grown: import fruits say, "come try me," but the waste says, "don't buy me." i think twice when the food miles are known. 
north korea's resumed its aggression; we've been called to extraordinary session, routine business completed. this new question's heated: more talk or response by repression? 
envision the hummingbird, reader? flitting lightly from flower to feeder. her swift daily duty embodies pure beauty, and my columbines earnestly need her. 
i'm afraid of my kid's fontanel, the idea of which doesn't sit well. a soft cranial spot? clever planning it's not. if i press, will i head straight to hell? 
fetch your father, my boy, but don't dally. lurking footpads await in each alley. they'd confront you, or, worse, slit your neck for your purse. god forbid you face such a finale! 
my microscope's focusing knob zeroes in on the slimy green blob i've just plucked from my nose. a bit gross? i suppose. self-absorption's an arduous job. 
if you'd burgle what honest folk buy, i've made my home a fortress; don't try. it's got trap doors to hell. it's my own bates motel. think you'll leave in one piece? when pigs fly! 
an appeal would be clutching at straws. as things stand now, you're caught in his claws. if a t's gone uncrossed, your whole surety's lost, as spelled out in the forfeiture clause. 
got no word for it? label it foo. no one minds if the naming's untrue. your new app's got a glitch? create foos, scratch that itch. use a placeholder name. muddle through. 
only guts, blood and feathers remain 'neath the flight path, the track, of the plane. stupid canada geese chose this group plan to peace: death by airbus. won't peta complain? 
i've retired to an island named yap? a mere flyspeck, a dot on the map. she's a green, tranquil rock, a few huts and a dock. may she never be roused from her nap. 
give me men with a passion for tools, not for fopperies?fashion and jewels. guys too into themselves, with the macho of elves, i reject. masculinity rules! 
she's remodeled our nick as we feared: he's conventionalized, and it's weird. look, he's wearing a suit, he's begun to commute, and she's sheared his magnificent beard. 
raw cotton provisions my gin. it's a feedstock that keeps coming in. lousy harvest, i'm done, nearly back to square one, but the gin's gotten under my skin. 
for your border beds: sugar and spice, (called foamflower too) will suffice? rising salmony-whites will reach moderate heights. take it home with you now, at half price. 
feasibility? study it, sure. but run freight trains on only manure? the scheme's chances are scant, yet we did get the grant. ("eco friendly" is always a lure.) 
they do immelmans, barrel rolls, loops, and a sequence of falconine swoops. they are daredevil fliers whose only desire's to delight and inspire the troops. 
goose migrations are something i dread 'cause their flyway is right overhead. yearly goose droppings season is quite enough reason to don slickers or stay home in bed. 
boss, when word of this screw-up gets loose, we fall back on our well-worn excuse: you were clueless; confess it. the press? they won't press it. they're toadies; let's put them to use. 
sharp-tailed grouse, on their dancing grounds (leks), strut about in a prelude to sex. there, midst short prairie grasses, they swell their plump asses while inflating their fine-feathered necks. 
call it foolhardiness (youth, if you will), but it's peril i love?for the thrill. i would argue old scratch for the chill of the match. when i change, i'll be over the hill. 
our skin cream's been making folks blink so damn wildly they're turning to drink. the new formula's wrong; something doesn't belong: there's a flaw in the ointment, i think. 
foreign policy kept jim up nights; no one else saw the world by his lights. old diplomacy hands heeded saner demands. and jim's fans readjusted their sights. 
john, your husband, bequeathed with his heart. all is yours, capital messuage apart: his home, land and sheds fall to chuck when he weds, the old barn to john's favorite tart. 
"electronic devices prevail; turn aside, now and then, to exhale," disconnectionists urge. "give the soul time to purge," they persist, and i counter, "no sale." 
by attacking each task with sincerity, keenly, edna leads all to prosperity; none can doubt edna's fervor we're honored to serve her. she will leave a mark on posterity. 
fossiliferous cambrian shales feature small benthic fauna, not whales. impressions appear well preserved and quite clear? ancient sea life, instructive details. 
while survivors are not done with crying, when they've not yet abandoned denying, perhaps meat's in decay? larval flesh fly buffet. sarcophagidae dine on the dying. 
my style's spartan: my books and my cat, unlike fothergill's flossy new flat. where i'm warm second-hand, he's importantly grand, but as tasteless as mousse made non-fat. 
"he'll attack from the east at first light," opines bradley, who's generally right. "from the skies, hit him hard with our mightiest card: our unstoppable air support, dwight." 
it's just carbuncles, nothing severe? a few bealings right here, in your ear. they're unlikely to spread; soon they'll come to a head, and we'll cleanse them; they'll all disappear. 
with a flourish, beau entered and bowed as though doffing a fine silken cloud? every gesture dramatic, his mien charismatic. men grumbled; their women were wowed. 
that she's married i've known from day one; though our banter's been coarse, it's but fun: conversation far short of the criminal sort. now her mate claims i fathered their son. 
worked in filigreed flowers of gold, his work's crafted with never a mold, but with fine-pointed pliers and gossamer wires. each brooch is a joy to behold. 
his tax burden felt like a ton, but this filer's convinced he has won: forms are signed and submitted (pray nothing's omitted). for the nonce, he has stood off the hun. 
to acacias and similar plants, many beltian bodies draw ants. are the structures delicious? they're richly nutritious, and acacias crave ants in their pants. 
his pronouncements have stirred up a flap (has he ever believed all that crap?) so we fuss over small things: such ado about all things! he observes, but he won't take the rap. 
our "green" dwelling's a yurt with no door, but a flap, so security's poor. pull that canvas aside; we've got nothing to hide? just some straw standing in for a floor. 
that's a lancehead, a fer-de-lance, mack; from its bite you might never come back. learn to know it and well. the snake's toxic as hell. just your heat could provoke an attack. 
learning nature's hard ways at first hand, we've decided to fence in our land, else the cattle will stray or be taken as prey. open range locos don't understand. 
our climate's predictably dry, and there's rarely a cloud in our sky. but of late, it's turned zany, always coming on rainy. plan a picnic? god spits in your eye. 
war unthinkable? sadly, it's here. sarajevo's the flashpoint; that's clear. the foul deed has decreed all of europe will bleed. after this comes the deluge, i fear. 
they're effete; let's restore them, which means we'll breed back?recreate ancient genes: the organic solution, reverse evolution. we'll return to original scenes. 
we've bred two pairs of catholic twins, our reward for indulgence in sins: kids born ten months apart. now the work's off the chart. still, they're precious, so no violins. 
a fig marigold bed's ornamental and may spread by degrees incremental. small flower heads last past when others have passed, but the seedlings want care. please be gentle. 
the outdoor shop's got plants by the box. let's stock up on a few flats of phlox. several shades will be best, and not much to invest. our old rock garden's down to just rocks. 
when your lyric's too dark for your sound, there's a method to turn that around: flat the pitch; it turns blue, lets the mournful seep through. a mere semitone drop is profound. 
she'll be running flat out for a while? open throttle?that's always her style. in her eye-popping sprint, she shows never a hint of exertion, then ends with a smile. 
soon the sword fight grew fierce and robust. there was many a furious thrust. it was foin, parry, slash, then the point hit: a gash! too damned fast?we all left in disgust. 
the soundtrack this movie requires must be all its producer desires. the story's flat boring, but if music is soaring? anthemic?it stokes the crowd's fires. 
here from iceland she came, azure-eyed, flaxen-haired and with cold, brazen pride. then her cornsilk-gold tresses brought strings of successes with men, who just gulped, gaped and sighed. 
there's a rich golden tone to our brew. nature's flavonoids lend it that hue. and there's no call to panic: they're healthful, organic, aromatic?good stuff through and through 
where he flops every night on his chair, you will notice a flattening? there. and the smell's less than sweet where he burdens the seat. it's near leveled and begs for repair. 
the forces of evil are swelling. there are thousands; the proof is compelling. the good shall survive, and our culture shall thrive. once they're slain, we'll have tales that want telling. 
speak the speech. neither grimace nor quiver; they're but choric, the lines you deliver. here description's the point. got your nose out of joint? okay, actor, then act?just a sliver. 
"that's our enterprise, muscle in motion," said old sparky, with pride and devotion. "bet if action breaks out, she'll be somewhere about. she's the fightingest ship on the ocean." 
there's some ore here, but mighty poor yield: bits of float have washed down to your field. so the bedrock up yonder is something to ponder. in situ, there's more left concealed. 
one more win if i stay to compete, but the mayor then suffers defeat. call the fifth quarter mine and, instead, i'll resign? hide and tallow?our deal is complete. 
she's a spirited, lovely brunette, but her eyes say, "apartments to let." more than simple, short-changed, she's a trifle deranged, and the sexiest girl i've met yet. 
our fiddle-footing son disappears? he's a-roaming; my wife is in tears. something draws him away. he'll return some fine day, to be sure, but with strange souvenirs. 
keep him calm; the kid's fixing to bolt. he's high-strung as a fiddle-foot colt. is it nerves or just fleas? he keeps bouncing his knees. bring the whisky. we'll slip him a jolt. 
shut some instruments down; that's the drill. you'll find flying by contact a thrill, keeping track of position by landmark. your mission: gain awareness, but first write your will. 
with his fiddle, zeke's off sowing seed. the odd implement's built for that need? a once-common display, farmers bowing away, but the name wasn't picked to mislead. 
success in a fire-hunt relies on the torchlight thrown back from the eyes of some night-active prey (this way's futile by day). is this fair? if a meal is the prize. 
comes a mist of the murkiest sort; every lobsterman's anchored in port. we in rockport can't win: a dense fog mull's set in. no one's fishing for profit or sport. 
we've refined this proposal all day. its few faults are at last fined away (or hidden in jargon; it sounds a real bargain). aim for perfect, but deal with okay. 
neither beauty nor talent nor toil, but a few dabs of follow-me oil will so turn a lad's head and perfume him to bed that the notion makes mothers recoil. 
my love for my hound's off the scales. as a find dog, however, he fails. he enjoys a good hunt, but his nose?i'll be blunt? turns up nothing but other hounds' tails. 
nine a.m., just got up, and i'm groggy; light outside's kind of weak? guess it's foggy. while the sun burns it off, i'm bogged down in my trough. thought by now i'd dry out. yet, i'm soggy.
"look! the monkey house," zoo-goers say, by a fingerpost pointing the way. it's an eye-catching hand on a pole in the sand. "hope the rascals get nasty today." 
momma figures i'm out on a date. i expect she'll be waiting up late. i'll walk in; she'll be fuming. i hate her assuming! what galls me? mom's got it all straight. 
filthy rich is a fine way to be; not so fine's filthy dirty. that's me. i part crowds with my smell. ain't it fine to excel? i'm begrimed to the utmost degree. 
momma's mentally under the weather. though she once had her act well together. now she can't cut the mustard. befuddled and flustered, mom goes missing; best get her a tether. 
these flycatchers' scissor-shaped tails are called forficate (notably males'). one's just perched on a post; i should offer a toast to his tail. the attempt sadly fails. 
my oils might be lost on a wall? easel paintings, they're stunning but small, to be held in one's hands, perhaps mounted on stands or alone down a long, narrow hall. 
my old stetson fair shrugs at the rain; my long fish-skin ain't like to complain. i'm a range-ridin' feller neck to boots in slick yeller, and that's all i'm about to explain. 
skip the gala, son? heaven forfend! the first families of boston attend. it's our main meet-and-greet with the brahmin elite. you just may make a powerful friend. 
now, even as barbie's asleep, ken's off early to see to his sheep, but their long, stolen night each accepts wasn't right. each has promises, sadly, to keep. 
ethidium bromide's a stain that with dna tends to enchain. one nice trait it possesses: it coolly fluoresces. ask a lab wonk why that is germane. 
i've been altered?it's worse than i feared! my new finger wave's seriously weird. will i pass as a rapper with hair like a flapper? well, perhaps it goes well with my beard. 
an amati for purchase?i'm floored? at a price even we can afford! wait, the neck appears clean; there's an evident sheen. damn! the fingerboard's clearly restored. 
boorish conduct's a mealtime disgrace. he keeps pointing his fork in my face. he should wield it to eat, or to pick up some meat, but he waves it all over the place. 
win her heart. win by virtue and dint of fine words fire-new from your mint. wit may woo as fine wine; turn her head and she's thine? her won eye 'gins to twinkle and glint. 
use the flatboats tied up alongshore. they will flat your goods fresh from your store. slow but sure, they'll deliver to merchants downriver. the damn railroads will charge you far more. 
at our flag station, trains seldom stop? empty platform's a sorry old prop. but a service request will be duly addressed. (while you wait, kindly visit our shop.) 
here's to trixie, the new hire from dixie? energetic, incessantly fixy. tiny flaws she detects she detests, then corrects. we indulge her. she's cute as a pixie. 
a broadhead's a tip for an arrow with more clout than you'd need to hunt sparrow. extra sharp, extra wide (as its namers implied), aimed precisely, it's through to the marrow. 
on the racecourse, he's eager for action, 'cause his biddy bridle stymies distraction. wearing blinders, he's docile, won't rear, bite or jostle. when retired, he'll have stud satisfaction. 
once a fortress rose up round this city, her walls undisturbed?out of pity. the old order stumbled; those walls simply crumbled. what remains of her guns isn't pretty. 
eccentric? that doesn't half say it. maggie's fitified frenzies betray it. as occasion permits, sure, forgive her her fits. it's her manner. just don't underplay it. 
"fetch the cake slice; we'll divvy the pie?" she looks flummoxed, and doesn't comply (odd requests can unnerve her). "the triangular server." the utensil is soon standing by. 
we were blasting to make one more goal. the drill fitchered in loose, seamy coal: one more drill bit gone stuck, one more stroke of bum luck. wish i'd never gone down in the hole. 
"see how lightly she forks her fine steed," i observed, and all present agreed. "and take into account how she looks on her mount? as our queen, she'll fulfill the fair's need." 
after work, dad's content to just flop, close his eyes and snore loudly nonstop. it's been claimed all is movable to god. that's disprovable: he's tried, but can't mobilize pop. 
they were happy; of that there's no doubt, but they've just had a sad falling-out. the invective, the blaming! they're beyond all reclaiming. seems he's eaten her last pan-fried trout. 
once the wary turned tail and had fled, we saw signs that we wished we'd misread: under purpling skies, swarms of choughs and red flies. all spoke darkly of evils ahead. 
danny drove as though trying his luck? suicidal or merely a schmuck? in the death seat dee waited for whatever was fated. she'd've jumped, but the lap belt was stuck. 
feijoada's a joy to devour: pork and beans?with some manioc flour (called farofa down here) and a portuguese beer. have a classic brazil happy hour. 
i'm employed to evaluate wine, to distinguish the base from the fine. some bouquets are so heady i'm rendered unsteady? a drag, but the burden is mine. 
"eschew obfuscation," it's said, but avoidance is something i dread. muddle up, but with grace, with a smile on your face, then, untroubled, go blithely to bed. 
bailing out at this point's a mistake. first consider the profits we'll make. popularity's spreading for our pre-flavored breading. and that brand name? come on?shake 'n bake! 
something's troubling me, lads; i'll be blunt: from day one, you've been leading, in front. if at first you've succeeded, your gloating's unneeded. the dance was a damned childish stunt. 
rare gemstones so finely engraved he amassed and eternally craved, says this latest biography. antique dactyliography was the art by which sam was enslaved. 
i'm a floater, and wand'rin's my way, with new friends and new sights every day. since it cast me adrift, life's been gumption and thrift: snag some grub and slip softly away. 
hon, it's totally proper and fitting that your brother pitch in with our flitting. once we're moved, settled in, joe's incursions begin? uninvited, ill-timed, unremitting. 
she's a child, but that voice is legit. sure, the headphones she's wearing don't fit. her head shrinks in those cans (which are clearly a man's)? but she rocks them! the look is a hit. 
i don't trust a bar neat as a pin; they'll pour belly wash, not honest gin: why should anyone choose their deplorable booze? the beer's dreary; the rum rots your skin. 
"common sense? you have nary a shred. oughtta bore for the simples," we said: "make a hole, add a spout, and it dribbles right out: the damned foolishness filling your head." 
from the attic, a footfall is heard. some rough beast's sensed a presence and stirred! his walk's shuffling, dragging; my resolve to stay's flagging. have i roused something fearsome and furred? 
this lousy bum leg is a pain (all i do lately's loaf and complain). my whole world's been derailed since the surgery failed. even taking a crap is a strain. 
it was calm, not a hint of a breeze when a flaw blew in, bending the trees. women fled and kids cried, then as quickly, it died. maybe sometimes the sky needs to sneeze. 
indecision's a trait that i hate, so the time came to fish or cut bait. he still harbored a doubt, so i told him, flat out, "hit the road, jack, and please latch the gate." 
first response goes beyond mere abstraction; use of ethane improves our reaction. we need well-structured facts, or we'll spin in our tracks, but if data's exact, we get traction. 
these old coal shafts, though no longer mined, can be hazards for those left behind. kids delight to explore in air courses galore. some are trapped; fate is often unkind. 
when the facts are against you, keep grinning and sound certain. you'll look like you're winning. waste no time with persuasion. use verbal evasion. this doublespeak keeps their heads spinning. 
she's asleep now, at last; that's a blessing. the late news is so often distressing, about hatreds and blight. let's not watch it tonight, and turn in. i could use some caressing. 
my pop joined the angels last may. he's returned in a mystical way as a breeze through the wheat, but he feels more complete. anagogically, pop seems okay. 
you teed off for a round at the club, then nipped out for a round at the pub, but showed little remorse. now you're banned from our course. you have acted delinquently, bub. 
before hitting the floor for her dance, she'd delineate moves in advance. with meticulous care, she'd then slowly strip bare? a luxurious, crafted romance. 
there's no fard in a farding-bag, bud, but digesta, a cow's source of cud. women's fard is cosmetics, their tools of aesthetics, while this ruminant stomach churns crud. 
here's a change page to learn right away, with new lines and new blocking, okay? our concerns have been solved and the screenplay's evolved. it's the scene that we're shooting today. 
your archil's a violet dye (also cudbear, though don't ask me why). certain lichens supply it; pharmacologists buy it for tinctures. it pleases the eye. 
most remained 'cause outside it was pouring, but the evening was crushingly boring: all those flip charts and graphs labelled "save the giraffes." by the close, half the turnout was snoring. 
come encounter the feasting of yore: tonight's special is spit-roasted boar, served in egerdouce sauce like you've not come across? an old treat rarely found anymore. 
this old boat ride's a fitting way back 'cross the harbor. the town's white on black late at night from the ferry. it's breathtaking?very, my city?can't wait to unpack. 
deviation's my now-and-then style: consternation in friends makes me smile. though i'm often more normal (to the prom i went formal), i exorbitate once in a while. 
keep your eye on this stunning beginner. his forthcoming movie's a winner, in previews. but soon he'll make teenagers swoon, go all dopey and start skipping dinner. 
women came for the tastings but stayed when the general, in medals and braid (his flashiest finery), entered our winery assuming he'd later get laid. 
one more nasty, unwinnable fight, but grape's fortified me for my plight. without strength from the bottle, i fear i would throttle the woman, which mightn't seem right. 
aeschynanthus cries out to be kissed by a sunbird. the two coexist. blooms like bright orange trumpets mimic lips of wee strumpets. this epiphyte thrives on the mist. 
an eye-servant loafs hereabout, schooled in skulking. at that he's devout. a past master of shirking, allergic to working, he perhaps may respond to your shout. 
our new facialists lotion your cheeks; you'll look youthfully gorgeous for weeks. these adepts know their stuff: what's too much, what's enough? how to polish old, withered antiques. 
i was bred in keewatin?a scion of indigenous groups?chipewyan. nature's lure's oversold and the cold's getting old. hell, i'm numb! if i'm lyin', i'm dyin'. 
this "justice" you keep on demanding? such chimney corner law has no standing. rights and writs don't have roots in some idle old coots swapping yarns in a bar at the landing. 
your attorney should cut to the chase. pompous flubdub's obscuring his case. empty bombast's excessive. (does he think it impressive?) and traffic court isn't its place. 
where the flows of old scotland run deep, ancient selkies and stoor-worms still sleep. i've walked cold, lonely days by those boreal bays and heard wails never vented by sheep. 
we've achieved our decomposite ends mixing three complementary blends: fusing tex-mex, south asian and a base of  fine cajun, we're the latest in haute cuisine trends. 
we hit town and move into a flop (still, as flops go, the cream of the crop): there's a sheet and a towel (though the towel smells foul), and the joint serves some mighty fine slop. 
the last crosspiece: we're through, if i'm right, once we plane it and fay it in tight. the hull's sturdy but sweet, and just short of complete. a skilled boatwright's not taught overnight. 
he was fifty, and she twenty-one. both were lonely, both longing for fun. they signed papers, swapped rings, said the time-honored things, and, formalities done, they were one. 
her designs vaguely formed, she set out, no more wit than a damp april sprout. then she patterned her goals off the wisdom of polls. from damned clueless, she's warped to devout. 
your young flutterbudget?how she takes on; how she flits about hither and yon! jangled nerves, foolish notions, capricious emotions. her head must be full of chiffon. 
i, just now, had an almost-collision, caused by floaters invading my vision? roving squiggles and spots (now i've aged, i've got lots)? can't describe them with any precision. 
once auctioned, a piece has its price, but antique sales are dodgy as dice: further biddings ensure the thing's worth is secure. perhaps wait till it's marketed twice. 
still performing, four decades and more, they're chicago, though changed from before, rebuilt from the era of peter cetera, with alternate paths to explore. 
played on greenswards, a sport has appeal. whether sodded or seeded, it's real. played on artificial turf it's like fondling a smurf: animation, but lacking the feel. 
an arranged marriage, not of her choosing? she's wealthy, but think what she's losing. he's made fortunes in minks, but he's ugly and stinks, and he drinks. she'll be in for a bruising. 
i'm armorially honored, at last for my service to kings in the past: fines and tributes collected too long seemed neglected. an escutcheon's now mine; what a blast! 
he's complacent at first?feels prepared. once arraigned, in the system, he's scared. sure, the bum had it coming, but the prospect is numbing: in court, all his flaws would be aired. 
he's been woozy and lost for a spell. now he's ready to answer the bell. all their vile double-dealing for a while had him reeling. now he's back he'll disperse them to hell. 
the mad ruling's been cancelled, of course. ah, but even annulled it has force. guns were never forbidden, but we still keep them hidden: trust the quashing? consider the source. 
"your allotted years, threescore and ten, have expired," i reminded her. then, grinning coyly, she winked and said, "i'm not extinct. i'll be ready if you have the yen." 
you're mean and emotional, true? very anal expulsive of you. frequent loss of control? sigmund freud's on a roll. i'd say couch time is long overdue. 
sliding doors that don't quite overlap leave a bothersome long, narrow gap. but a slim molding strip, a low-key, humble lip, called an astragal, caps the gap's yap. 
every anxious seat's taken today, 'cause the clanton clan's filled them to pray. comes the news of the capture, and strain becomes rapture, and somebody mumbles, "hooray!" 
senior moment? you're just growing old, as the brain clouds get lonelier, cold. while adrift in that cloud, remain strong and unbowed. though you're? damn! who put my brain on hold?" 
of poached eggs i'm a true devotee. on fine mornings, i'll have two or three. eggs should cook right throughout, not be sloshing about as they simmer. an egg ring's the key. 
there's a rag in each player's rear pocket which you'd snatch, but they're off like a rocket. if it raises your hackles that flag football lacks tackles, it's got girls in tight jeans, so don't knock it. 
got the fidgets, my boy? have a drink. it should settle your nerves in  blink. have i gone a bit far, seeing how young you are? and your diaper's beginning to stink. 
at the outset, he talked a good line, then cordiality? soon in decline: seeming frankness, illusory? his clique grew exclusory. now boosters decamp from cloud nine. 
our ship has a home port, perforce, where she's logged as a "waterborne horse." she flies colors burmese to save registry fees? just a flag of convenience, of course. 
once our clinic announced they'd go under, we made feverish efforts to fund her? gave the old college try. but the last grant's gone dry. cue the music or, better yet, thunder. 
play the "lay for the age of aquarius." air it out on your sweet stradivarius. it's an aerious air, like a spiritless prayer, yet exalted. i find that hilarious. 
we must formularize first, then proceed: list all steps and all stuff we may need. since our scheme, once completed, may yet be repeated? even such an exceptional deed. 
once she cruised, but she hasn't fared well, serving now as a quayside boatel. her rich state rooms less stately, she rusts, if sedately, her screws nevermore to propel. 
our fool familymoon, burdened with brats, several exes and four or five cats, booked by pairs in denial soon turned trauma and trial. when we booked it, we must have been bats. 
it's a plank at the end of a pole, and on concrete, a bull float's chief role, surface water extraction, is like genius in action. level flatwork's the tool's simple goal. 
our shop's mangle is much in demand, because flatwork's not ironed by hand: cotton tablecloths, sheets, stuff not broken by pleats. ruffled froufrou's a pain, and is banned. 
"signal's clear once again: five by five. thought i'd lost you; thank god you're alive. was your aerial wrecked? did your rig disconnect?" "cool your jets, jack; i went for a drive." 
there's an odd, indefinable charm to my boom truck's extendable arm. heavy goods still need crating? she's my lady in weighting. then she'll hoist any burden?no harm. 
if a dip's to excel, then one hopes that his fagin will show him the ropes: lifting wallets with ease, growing fat by degrees, with prestige on a par with the pope's. 
only concrete? 'twill crumble; i'm loath. ferroconcrete is best, 'pon my oath. our young prince's endorsement of steel reinforcement shows the palace is grooming for growth. 
this snow's not the setback we feared; all arterious routes have been cleared. it's already subsiding. still, the mayor's in hiding? the case since the first flake appeared. 
your chased critter's not hanging around. any moment, she'll (swoop!) go to ground. wield your stick, spade or sledge? your earthed beast has the edge, smugly certain she'll never be found. 
we'll find freshly dug earths on these slopes to which critters have pinned their poor hopes. by the end of this day we'll have bagged loads of prey. they're well-hid, but the hounds know the ropes. 
stuart's cavalry's blessed with the smarts for the foraging?great in these parts. they've found fodder for horses and several fine sources for vittles. it's gladdened our hearts. 
the man's dewy-eyed troops of believers? are they blind or na?ve self-deceivers? moonstruck babes in his thrall, they're apologists all, deferential as drooling retrievers. 
i think fruit boosts the look of my plates. from the start, it says freshness awaits. tiny black champagne grapes garnish coq au vin crepes? presentation! chef joseph creates. 
arundinaceous? you jest?call it "reedy," that phragmites. or leave it at "weedy." meanwhile, gather a batch; it makes marvelous thatch. we'll erect a few huts for the needy. 
coral walls lend a welcoming feeling, while pale biscuit's the thing for the ceiling: it's warm glow will pervade and its crisp, toasty shade (till this cheap chinese paint begins peeling). 
our big blast scene needs natural gas. folks at equity won't let it pass. unapproved union shoots guarantee union suits. we're on hold?what a pain in the ass! 
she insisted on fiddleback oak for our floors, but the cost was no joke. "it's got fabulous grain," she cooed, "hon. don't complain." she's persuasive; i folded; we're broke. 
lest it roll off and drop to the ground, a good carpenter's pencil's not round. it's squared off or it's flat and you know where it's at: where you parked it, still hanging around. 
pull your troops from your neighbor's terrain! disannex it! our edict is plain. quit your trumped-up excuses for greed and abuses. what you've killed for you may not retain. 
as my forebears kept bouncing around, any sense of belonging was drowned. from the exclave, east prussia, we fled east to russia, then danzig?perhaps homeward bound. 
you'd bet dollars to donuts, you said, that before this thing's done, you'd be dead. your conclusion's foregone; make that dahlias, you're on. when you croak, i want flowers instead. 
her prose isn't bound by constraints: deep-dyed villains and out-and-out saints, poorly limned, undercooked. still, the last time i looked, she'd grown rich?no regrets, no complaints. 
a cheap pick-up, i thought?i'm a schmuck. turn the key, tap the pedal?then duck! probability's strong something bad will go wrong. defectibility lurks in this truck. 
having crewed on a deep-waisted smack all these years, it came time to change tack. now a loftier place, the high fo'c's'le's my base. i look aft, but i rarely look back. 
his new creed has decivilized kroll beyond empathy, culture or soul. to what beast does he answer, what insatiable cancer? may he plunge in a deep, noxious hole! 
has she cast her deciding vote yet? no?she milks it and plays hard to get. hell, i no longer care if we're here or we're there. i've grown sick of this slow minuet. 
daily chores on our farm aren't fair, like the chaff box: looks tame, but beware. best be quick on the draw when you're mangling straw. lop-hand larry's one short of a pair. 
i bought it, i own it; it's mine, but it hangs at the met by design. it's on loan at that site, but my droitural right brings it home thirty years down the line. 
come on, buster, just say what you mean: circumbendibus garbles; come clean. here's a novel suggestion: stop dodging the question. did you know that the girl was sixteen? 
billy's birth brought his ma profound pleasure, but his rearing's more trouble than treasure: he's a headstrong young pup, so the boy's fetching-up has too often meant trials beyond measure. 
the town fence viewer's crooked as hell, and his work habits? lazy as well. he's a petty official, but we need his initial, which the scoundrel's been known to misspell. 
it's gone rotten; the log's all aglow. fox-fire fungi have this to bestow, spawning many a tale told to turn children pale: midnight lights in the forest?oh, no! 
it's been two weeks already? who knew? freakin' fortnightly sex has come due. i "i do-ed" the old dragon? i'll have to start shaggin'. i'll shut my fool eyes till it's through. 
the flamingo is awkwardly tall. one was eating; i thought she would fall in the lake where she fed when she upturned her head: the ungainliest bird's feat of all. 
we're triplets, and reared with each other. to the world, we flat match one another. there's a favorance twixt us, yet mom's never mixed us; she'll spot signs only seen by a mother. 
we're a passionate crew at the priory, where moods swing from placid to fiery. his intemperate thirst makes our prior the worst, as you'll learn once i publish my diary. 
she's served up, and looks naughty but nice on this pool raft designed to entice. like a lamb to the slaughter, she bobs on the water on her floating flirtation device. 
woody cat's claws are vines to explore, to fight cancers, arthritis and more. at least two by that name have earned local acclaim? acclaim most modern doctors ignore. 
although dad was a man with a mission, spending years touting perfect nutrition, to conclude that our clan went along with his plan is a fallacy called composition. 
have a lit'rally fabulous day, children. follow, for i have the way: scale rapunzel's rare locks, match your wits with the fox. there'll be oodles of ogres to slay. 
look, i'm sorry you heard that, okay? ?that my bobble could turn you away. having said what i said, i deserve to "drop dead." (and i'm sure dustbin beeper's not gay.) 
you're drowning; please do so with grace. if you flounder about, you lose face. rise above the wild norm; die with class, in good form. if you flail, show some tempo and pace. 
lately, kissing involves tasting lips: what's that, cherry? egad?fish and chips! flavored lipsticks?distractions, offensive infractions? whose screw-up was this? fetch my whips. 
"she's astonishingly sexy, your daughter." "and strikingly deadly?i taught her. better back off and quit. you won't know what's just hit you. you'd go easy, a lamb to the slaughter." 
dzhugashvili, to violence prone, was a tyrant most wished overthrown. so he'd murder them first if they muttered or cursed. russians still think of stalin and groan. 
over fifty feet tall is big tex. (and imagine his other huge specs!) want the texas state fair? once y'all see him, you're there. approach too close, you're craning your necks. 
he's self-made, self-assured, self-proclaimed, so his album's eponymously named. it's called, plainly, me, jim, with a photo of him on the jewel case, impressively framed. 
daylight filtered through leaves appears gentle: shun the sun. keep your light accidental. use the moon or a candle. though harder to handle, the ethereal mood's elemental. 
a script workable, easily read, carolingian minuscule spread. it was legible, clear, and soon used far and near, as the book hand lurched slowly ahead. 
rocky spoke with commanding finality: that was that, not an if, no neutrality. then he changed his fool mind, the whole scheme left behind. we poor peasants would deal with reality. 
the old autograph tree in the yard has to go, but it's gonna be hard, 'cause my girl's signed the leaves and, disheartened, she grieves, "if you harm it, our future's ill-starred." 
i'd assumed all along i was right. found out different last saturday night: i'd thought toto was tame. i was wrong; now i'm lame. and the monster's not even contrite! 
we've found figural art in these caves? perhaps aurochs attended by slaves. nothing abstract's around, or it's yet to be found. still, we haven't begun on the graves. 
my new volume with foldouts of rome is unwieldy and craves its own home. normal size is exceeded; a book cradle's needed for display and to page through this tome. 
blown off course to this desolate isle, i'm forgotten, yet living in style: food and water throughout it, nothing "desert" about it? desert island, i'll linger awhile. 
biological attacks are our bane, preservation of books our domain. roaches, book lice and mold, never fully controlled, eat adhesives and drive us insane. 
like a tome for an elegant elf, there it rests on my curio shelf? just four inches around, but most splendidly bound? it's my bibelot. see for yourself. 
cool and clumsy,  and round as a quail, god's experiment: fated to fail! might this large, passive meal have dodged slaughter? get real! dopy dodos would never prevail. 
the girl's mother so clearly enjoys watching bess flirt her curls at the boys. the wrong boy takes the bait; mom wakes up?far too late. mothers' pride very often destroys. 
a projectionist's change-over cue, a small dot, said a reel switch was due. but done poorly, it meant an unruly event: missing marks led to hullabaloo. 
there are maids to kiss, dragons to slay, yet your hours are just fiddled away. not a day's left to waste; a few maids are still chaste? there's still time to lead someone astray. 
bare of fist, as we say, fist and skull, they went at it with nary a lull. all declared it was fair. then it ended?right there. wild and bloody it was, never dull. 
as its colors change hour by hour, you discover this world of the tower. so take a companion on walks through bryce canyon: enjoy nature's rock-sculpting power. 
handsome eland appear to our eyes: twisting horns, dewlapped necks and great size. these antelopes' browns grace woodlands (not towns) or savannas, 'neath blue afric skies. 
descriptive grammar says, "this way is right? or it's wrong." grammar rules ain't polite. it's accepted, ok, if it's heard every day, though it's likely to change overnight. 
teleprompters are useless ? know why? he'll rephrase you before your "ink's" dry, without missing a beat: this one thinks on his feet. he'll emend and delete on the fly. 
i'll be "pulling" an audax next week, which demands all my cyclist's physique: gotta lead the whole route with my lines in pursuit. constant speed, pre-set stops. it's unique. 
at the head of a glossary leaf you'll see catchwords; they'll save you some grief. the intent's cut and dried: as a word-seeker's guide, like "this page runs from moth to motif." 
it's an interlude meant to provoke, this fantasia of jazz and baroque. with this wild, carefree style, free of boundary or guile, music's altered at one swinging stroke. 
if an enemy flourished a blade, i, no hero, would swiftly be swayed. should the foeman bear steel, my poor blood would congeal. better kneel than be flayed and filleted. 
as of right, all these holdings are mine, and my governance largely benign. as i please, thus, i seize all the yields and esplees of its mills? and the fruit of the vine. 
"these potatoes are fingerlings, friend? just as thick as your thumb end to end. oiled, seasoned and roasted, they're superb," the chef boasted. "even spuds, in my hands, can transcend." 
since our forebears arrived on these shores, many millions have flocked to our stores. on-line shopping's destroyed us. the youngsters avoid us. it's over: we're closing our doors. 
there's a cable ferry 'cross lake champlain. it's slow, but complaints are in vain. please do not pop your cork on your trip to new york. you'll earn nothing but glares of disdain. 
a dissenter has now lost his voice; the complacent must surely rejoice. the now executed giant is no longer defiant? laryngitis eternal?their choice. 
before novels appear at the shops, this vocation's been plying its chops: bibliogony's books? their production, their looks? an obscure art, but grant it its props. 
you're wrong, sir, with all due respect: exoneration's too much to expect. you predict you'll be free? i'm afraid that won't be. when you sideswiped that nun, you were wrecked. 
the magnificent african flame tree and the chilean aren't the same tree. the latter, in fact, is more bush?more compact, not deserving, some feel, of the name tree. 
a scarred carcass is all that remains of a couch left behind on the plains. its upholstery gone, the oak frame lingers on, stripped by heat and by cold, soaking rains. 
her hair feltered and flat, as from sex stirred old cravings in me, belowdecks. from her pallet she rose. there and then, i suppose, i fell right back in lust with my ex. 
we'll be starting a backfire right here so the hazard is not so severe. burn it out; that's the trick. get the drip torch, and quick? and a red card who's mastered the gear. 
gloryosky! ods bodkins! hell's bells! something nasty's invaded the wells. it's corroding our skin and eroding within: cytocidal, it's murdering cells. 
cystolithic's a grandiose word for the cramps my old bladder incurred when a stone tried to pass like a mass of crushed glass. rocks in there? the whole concept's absurd. 
giant zips on her clothes have me hopin' they're bold 'cause they want to be open. "here's the fastening, jack." it blares boldly, "attack!" ease of access with minimal gropin'. 
the net's out; now the problem's to shift her, so we sail in a craft called a drifter. the crew's singular wish is a netful of fish and a boat with a hoist fit to lift her. 
fin-de-siecle: motifs of decay in the arts?had the world gone astray? in the cynic's ennui lurked a soup?on of plea: the two thousands might yet be okay. 
your depurative's cleansing effect was intense. now i'm drawn, drained, and wrecked. i'm not meant to be pure, doc, so keep your fool cure. i'd as soon my gut rot from neglect. 
it's a focal infection, quite treatable. though one dose should work, it's repeatable. i've observed it firsthand; it's confined to a gland. modern imaging?man, it's unbeatable! 
if worked leather you're hoping to sell, you must learn where to pause for a spell. correct use of hot brass is a pain in the ass. often, tooling requires a dwell. 
from my shirts to my light summer slacks, i choose linens from bergdorf or saks. finest fibers are key, and from plants they must be? not synthetic, ma'am, flax?just the flax. 
your schemes for surviving the drought are quite sketchy, and need fleshing out. jurisdictions aside, arctic ice has been tried, and the nile might prove tough to reroute. 
at book checkout, try not to skip the encoded security strip: its deactivation (desensitization). our exit alarm is a pip! 
if it's movement you wish to convey, clever flow maps may well be the way. volume, source and direction are there for inspection. there's no end to what flow maps display. 
it's an auction; high bidder prevails. we'll need someone to cry off the sales? one who's naturally glib, who can slickly ad-lib, and spin tales about ten-penny nails. 
with a term-load  of research to read, you'll want coursepack; it's all you will need. it beats dragging around; it's excerpted and bound, and the whole ball of wax?guaranteed. 
damn the contraries! full speed ahead. re-used paper goods earn us our bread. staples, pins and such crap, once recycling's trap, filtered out, pave our roadways instead. 
"save the snail darter," nature nuts squeak; "they're exposed in this tennessee creek." preservationists prayed that our dam be delayed. ecological logic's damn weak! 
deprivation has kept me up nights. what's become of my spousal delights? give the baby a break; bliss awaits you?partake. don't deny my consortial rights. 
this drug's anxiogenic effects may be countered? in certain respects: yes, there's angst and mistrust, but concomitant lust may offset these, the research projects. 
is the flapjack some overweight crepe? no, this pancake's in fine eating shape. although some would say hotcakes, in my home they're not cakes. but a short stack's my morning escape. 
here in maine, it's full fiddle-heading season! not to hunt the young ferns would be treason. they're so tender in salads, i'm moved to pen ballads (our long winter is also a reason). 
guacamole dip? none of it's left. and of bridge mix the sideboard's bereft. so you'll have to admit the whole snack spread's a hit. tonight's poker, though, sure felt like theft. 
they held sway from well-guarded retreats, the old royals, the ruling elites. now, dominion-restricted, decrowned and evicted, deposed monarchs are prowling the streets. 
i called "lights" and the cast was flat floored, 'cause that flat shows a town by a fjord. but this scene's in old texas! and what's with the lexus? are the stagehands here drunk or just bored? 
no more climbing for me, and that's that! by tonight, i reside on the flat. my poor back's been complaining, whole carcass campaigning for rest, which i'm sure i've got pat. 
a flash smash well before it's on sale, the thing's hailed to its slightest detail. but with defects profuse, it flat fizzles in use, and, depopularized, punctured, turns stale. 
sue, i'm sorry. it's just as i feared: half your hair's on the floor; you look weird. your new coif's incomplete with the fall at your feet. like a ewe, you look partially sheared. 
i said, "ethyl's the fuel for my tank." but the pump jockey just drew a blank. "that means 'high-test,' you clown." then he said, with a frown, "so who's ethel, you muddled old crank?" 
like the apron to carry his seed, for the farmer each thing filled a need. but with dibbles around, other uses were found. discard nothing's the wise farmer's creed. 
for my verse, you're a callous mortician: you've depoetized every submission. an original trope in your hands has no hope, and is butchered beyond recognition. 
there, deplumate, she lay on the strand: a lost plover half-buried in sand, stripped of plumage and broken. the storm god had spoken with a certain and cold, heavy hand. 
keep your cold city sidewalks; they're scary. my favorance? life on the prairie. i feel free on the plains; they've sunk deep in my veins. urban living? eat, drink, but be wary. 
after opening night at the play came a wonderful finger buffet: vol-au-vents, canap?s they'd been making for days? all utensils and plates stashed away. 
does cross-country not challenge enough? step it up, man; don't leave in a huff. take a fell running flyer? all the climbs you require. i'm retired; i'll cheer from my duff. 
in some factories, angels are trained (well, not yet, but their fate's pre-ordained). there the sedulous squad hits the books about god. self-indulgent, god's never complained. 
your poem's set in gothic. what's worse, a tall drop cap begins every verse, invading the space of some lines. lack of grace in a typesetter's crude and perverse. 
cross-and-bible doors greet us with style, though today the old lore makes us smile: its six-panel design was to witches a sign that this home would endure any trial. 
certain leathers are made ?cras?. though uncommon, it's still done today. once it's crushed and compressed, it emerges distressed. a fine grain is what gives it away. 
a site called a cobweb's found where? on the web! no arachnids, though, there: not a visit in ages, no tweaks to its pages, it sits jilted with no one to care. 
bureau spending's a tad out of hand; i've got orders: "assert more command." i'm "the powers that be," so first clear it with me when your project is fresh, newly planned. 
of late i've been tempting the fates in cold waters where anchor ice waits. the traverse is worthwhile, for there's gold on an isle in these narrows i've named dire straits. 
in the deli it waits to be picked, true ingredients hard to predict: here's your lunch in the flesh, packaged more or less fresh in a clamshell. don't fight it; you're licked. 
delineatory strokes are a start and an outline, a frame, for my art. unfulfilled, though, they're static, so monochromatic? insipid?mere skin with no heart. 
young lancelot?damn, that kid fights. he's the ablest and truest of knights. so i wagered a guinea he wouldn't bed gwinny. i've lost. he was nabbed dead to rights. 
we're crisscrossed by fallen flag rails, some converted to greenways and trails? rights of way now grown over with thistle and clover, while the interstate system prevails. 
i have surfed through the internet's pages. though it draws me, it often enrages. instructive, arousing, but who joins me at browsing? surely, imbeciles, psychos and sages. 
as far as the brass are concerned, it was derequisitioned: returned to its previous role in civilian control. that proved tricky: the sarge had it burned. 
flinderation now litters the floor where i smashed poor aunt mabel's french door. i've been searching right hard for each chip, every shard, 'cause both mabel and door are pre-war. 
in a water-tub, apples are loot: fish one out with just teeth. it's a hoot! sure, such bobbing's traditional, but less than nutritional, and probably bad for the fruit. 
i've started a fanzine for mama. i'll portray there a full panorama of her virtues, in print. she deserves it, i'll hint, even more than that joker obama. 
could you please tone it down just a tad? all your bickering's driving me mad. you're at loggerheads nightly. try disputing politely, like, "shall we choose ziploc or glad?" 
in a book shop, i'm stunned, brought to tears, when a fabulous relic appears: a pristine ainsworth psalter. "however," i falter, "has it lasted these four hundred years?" 
where alternative history parts from the facts, there the writer's job starts. booth is checked; abe survives. mudd sells cures for the hives? no great shakes on the booksellers' charts. 
this kayaker's personal goal is elusive: an eskimo roll. to perform that full spin, popping up with a grin, demands fortitude, poise and control. 
having camped in this hidden ravine, we're evicted by risks unforeseen: there's a flash flood alert; it's decamp or eat dirt. desert sand's not our favorite cuisine. 
the follies flo ziegfeld has planned are extravagant?costly and grand as produced for the stage. they're the rage of the age. preferred seating is much in demand. 
"drink this compound?your bladder's like new," my french herbalist swore. it was true. no more sprints to the john and the burning's long gone. merci, buchu; cystitis, adieu. 
whether collards or cabbage or kale, we'll make certain that cole crops prevail, that when congress convenes it pays homage to greens. our kohlrabi house lobby can't fail. 
biographical pictures needs snipping, hence, biopics, by fore-and-aft clipping. influenza yields flu?; the word fridge shows it too. i'd go on, but this tale's less than gripping. 
beyond doubt, the new gift shop's first rate: varied stock, browsability great, indirect, skillful lighting; displays most inviting. your prize is there, lying in wait. 
though i've placed us, i think, on my map, there's a wide curiosity gap between factors i'm sure of and some i'll want more of. i'm a painstaking sort of a chap. 
where a book's in fine binding and fair, a chemise brings protection from wear, or misuse or damp weather. whether silk or soft leather, the book's swaddled. (it's ugly out there.) 
local drifters have heard about didi and her handouts of grub for the needy. the broad's a bit kookie, but good for a dukie. no seconds, though?mustn't seem greedy. 
when your shipment arrived, i was pissed. my request was for floss?with no twist. what i'm crafting demands six divisible strands. lisle is wrong. take it back, i insist! 
on the day a hot album's released, fans are drooling: the ways have been greased. long before the disc drops, a good manager's props have been earned, and it's on to the feast. 
to judge me, sir, by any decision of my neighbors (all fit for derision) assumes i'm like my town. the mere thought brings me down. it's a fallacy?that of division. 
primal nymph, we invoke your support: tempest-tossed, to your care we resort. o undine, elemental of water, be gentle. we're swamped; now the ball's in your court. 
"what do you know, you ignorant sprout? it takes cheek to call my plans in doubt! your idea's for the birds," he said. famous last words: three months later, the "sprout" chucked him out. 
martha'd shut her damn pie-hole up tight as a bull's ass in flytime?all night. did she let slip a word? not that that anyone heard. it was her way to put up a fight. 
connie's crossness will get her canned yet. she's damned surly and quickly upset. when that broad blows her stack, there's no holding her back. and that last time the boss won't forget. 
fanfare binding?these binders weren't fooling: leathered boards and gold leaf-enhanced tooling. there'll be magic inside; i'd display it with pride. damn the price tag! this book has me drooling. 
he's intractable, jill's new prince charming, his devotion to logic alarming. he disputes with true zeal, and his passion seems real. such discussional ardor's disarming. 
by the ganges, the flood plain is rich with alluvium. still, there's a hitch: fertile muds?marl and clay? washed from hills far away can wreak havoc. ain't farm life a bitch? 
the crusade labeled back-to-the-land promotes planting all free space at hand: warehouse roofs, vacant lots should sprout neighborhood plots. grow your own, it affirms?take a stand. 
the old salt muttered something obscene, then, "i'll meet you on fiddler's green. sassy strumpets and rum will await when you come." then he drowned; he's an aqua marine. 
it's a fibber mcgee's closet in there: mounds of rummage and no room to spare. one particular stack looks prepared to attack. it's been growling and shifting?i swear! 
caught flagrante delicto, engaged in the act, they were shocked?then enraged. on the web, then, surpassed by an all-monkey cast, they were admirably aped and upstaged. 
fool hussy's got no common sense; she's been quite the coquette with the gents. land sakes! did you ever? and the boss calls her clever. mercy me! what a turn of events. 
that dynamo hotshot we hired grew fatigable?easily tired. what weird weed was he taking, or was he just faking? no matter?last night he expired. 
acquiring through cold-hearted guile, acting execrably callous and vile, he clung close to the law, till his final hurrah, living lavishly large, in high style. 
our silk ferret remains in fine shape, and there's always a use for this tape: to bind parcels, edge scanties (we stock pink just for panties). the queen's seamstress seems fond of the grape. 
he imagined a night of romance; his passions rose deep in his pants. when his whispers proved rude, her declinal ensued: so genteelly she cooed, "not a chance." 
this new flapper style looks a bit odd, but it flatters a thick girl's fa?ade. yes, the drop-waist look's yummy and swallows the tummy. you're hot, daisy?honest to god. 
kramer sponged on you, that's what he did, like a leech on your ass, god forbid. now his greed's overtaken him; wisely, you've shaken him. leeches are bloodsuckers, kid. 
a distraction was all that it took, and his knight forked my bishop and rook. but he hadn't foreseen that the knight screened his queen. chess is beauty, and i am no schnook. 
my promotion felt more like defeat: the vast office suite wasn't so sweet. a small cubicle's bliss 'cause its walls nearly kiss. claustrophilia's more like my beat. 
at the fairgrounds, they'll charge you a penny for a whirl on a wild flying jenny. threats of mishap aside, it's a child-thrilling ride? a perennial highlight for many. 
in the old days, each port had its flake? like a platform?and ours took the cake: built to dry the day's catch, ours held every last batch. but to lodge there? a stinking mistake. 
we hear you're soon off on a trek. we'll supply your whole fitout?on spec: should it lead to a book, give our house the first look. meanwhile, try not to break your fool neck. 
an accepted promotional pairing shows distinctions not otherwise glaring. your competitor's car seems like yours from afar, so appose them; encourage comparing. 
it's new year's; we're tired, but reviving. our first-footers should soon be arriving, bearing fruit cake and wine, their appearance a sign that our home is thus blessed, indeed thriving. 
although flak jacket wearing's a perk, it would draw flak from jerks here at work. keep one near, standing by, in case lead starts to fly. meanwhile, chill?you're the property clerk. 
rainbow trout is a seasonal dish, and as tasty as any could wish. to a nice shady hole take your pliable pole? your best fly rod, your lures, and go fish. 
our carpenter's great; i approve? how he feathers each tongue for its groove. a securely made joint is a paramount point. signing heinz was our craftiest move. 
good sir toby, you belch?you're besotted, and with aguecheek frequently spotted. as you're witty and shrewd (if at times a bit lewd), poor malvolio fell when you plotted. 
after screw-ups had run us aground, we sensed hope that at last we'd rebound. we're no longer believing; the faint glow was deceiving: that false dawn's proved deeply unsound. 
can you fault me for canning their asses? he's stupid; she's slow as molasses. you expect, what? some sorrow? i'll forget them tomorrow, leaving only a stench?but that passes. 
it's draw day; i'll ask an advance. i could use extra cash at the dance. there'll be flowers and candy, later on, maybe brandy. for a logger, this stuff's high finance. 
where's our regular poker deck, dude? get a load of these court cards: all nude, every queen's lovely rack clearly interests her jack, and each king's up to something damned lewd. 
are you sidious, ruthful or ruly? or just trepid?now answer me truly. absent antonyms?freaks i've collected for weeks? may be wieldy; disport with them coolly. 
after grooming, my pet comes home dyed reddish orange. i'm fit to be tied: my newly tame dingo, his coat now flamingo! but my bruce takes it all in his stride. 
the hare's white now; this color's a phase that eludes every predator's gaze. he's a dun-colored blur in his summertime fur. evolution has ways that amaze. 
"bring your kids into line" was the norm in our homeland: ensure they conform. so the place was benighted. far removed now, delighted (though anxious), we're ripe to transform. 
when we're staffing, we aim for the mean: central casting types?standard, routine? not too smart or too hairy. atypical's scary. an orange is orange, not green. 
facilitation's the soul of our days: extrication from snags and delays. you'll be stunned how it feels once we've greased all your wheels. workin' web sites "r" us?we have ways. 
the archive is hurting for space. culling out, though, would be a disgrace. so we save it on fiche, photographically. sheesh? the condition! let's step up the pace. 
his assumptions will prove incorrect; it's a train wreck continued unchecked. he'll hear no one's opinions but his groveling minions', so, far be it from me to object. 
fertilization will follow, when fated, after couplings divinely x-rated: the old egg-and-the-sperm thing, the dead-bunnies-confirm thing. expecting, for most, means "elated." 
this month's ovum's released, like as not hitting nothing but fimbria. what fate waits for it hinges on chance past these fringes, and that sure but implausible shot. 
find my smock, child; i do look a fright; i'm especially grimy tonight. i've been slopping the hogs and de-lousing the dogs. my fool coverslut's nowhere in sight. 
we were playing the dozens that night, sir. his description of momma ain't right, sir: sure, the bitch is a junky, but she ain't no old monkey. i offed the damn fool in a fight, sir. 
kooky curlers know ways to have fun and the bonspiel's our favorite one. what could be more appealing than sweeping and kneeling on ice? ("hush! the match has  begun.") 
my old carriage clock runs a bit slow, like its owner. so that's apropos. its small handle, you'll note, makes it easy to tote, though in truth i've got nowhere to go. 
ben, i'm grateful you've sent me the blues for review. i'm afraid there's bad news: there are gaps in the copy; the font appears sloppy. my green light? i'll have to refuse. 
i'd prefer to be wed to ike's horse. ike's ill-mannered and boorish and coarse. like his stallion's, ike's spike has the specs that i like, so i think i'll defer the divorce. 
don't be trapped by what's right and polite. keep things practical, don't get uptight. expediential decisions ward off most collisions? but keep an escape route in sight. 
at the party, all eyes are on laura, who's dressed casual: just a fedora. a man's hat will suffice; laura aims to entice, so she sports little more than her aura. 
compact's inked; we are one with our mates, a now federated union of states. but with most largely farmed, and the urbanized armed, our young merger's in desperate straits. 
since milady's as quicksilver?fickle, milord's stratagems? clever and mickle. cockeyed (drunk) off a bender, he'll be maudlin and tender, and avert a connubial pickle. 
averruncate foul smaug?weed him out. the worm's charred half the shire with his snout. base entreaties won't work; he's been raging berserk. has the drake got draconian gout? 
forlorn hope? true, though some felt it needed. yet our sure futile gesture succeeded! though resigned to defeat then ignoble retreat, we all froze as our foes were stampeded. 
a loud message adorns her caboose. in pink flocking, her butt proclaims "juice" in raised letters. unfair! though she's sweet, you're aware: make a move and you've cooked your own goose. 
every four-flusher dreams he'll die rich, but big louie's a son-of-a-bitch. use that freakin' cold deck? you'd be risking your neck. if it's spotted, you'll die in a ditch. 
the feijoa, a guava-like fruit from new zealand, has growing repute. aromatic and sweet, its liqueur can't be beat. try the schnapps for a singular toot. 
always here by my side, ever handy, is my architect's scale; it's a dandy: with six scales on three faces, it covers all bases. and its pear wood bears scents of fine brandy. 
our interior fenestrate walls invite light to our stairways and halls. in these windowed surroundings, what's cool and astounding's the sense that the space fairly sprawls. 
shall we try a short feather cut, hon? it's a do that's both easy and fun. and (let's cut to the chase) it will frame that sweet face. you won't know yourself after we're done. 
see her eyebrows, that flash? that's a sign: recognition, and likely benign. it's impromptu and swift? conversational thrift. but don't read it as "your place or mine?" 
with its talents and uses untold, my dear food processor never grows old. when my life's all a-rush, it makes succulent mush, spinning madly?a sight to behold.

white hair, and white eyelashes too! when i saw her complexion, i knew? she was cute, albinotic, and oh, so exotic: divinely translucent to view.

its wiggly bright fronds standing straight, the anglerfish, sly, lies in wait. this method enables a turning of tables: a fish using worms as its bait. 
in state v. banana, i feel, the decision was far from ideal. the judge called a trip what was really a slip. i hope it's reversed on appeal. 
she's the goodiest two-shoes extant. have a drink or a smoke? no, she shan't. she strings me along with her adamant song, and all 'cause my haircut's aslant. 
submerged in the lake was my honda, then crushed by a large anaconda. he swallowed my car and grew larger by far. he combatted his fat with jane fonda. 
as a botanist, steve came to grips with the millions of plants without lips with acheilous, you know (vowels all in a row!): it's a word that he takes on his trips.

if you happen upon moldy nuts, best eschew them, no ifs, ands, or buts! their foul aflatoxin will spread like a pox in your liver, destroying your guts. 
though afraid means so scared you can't function, it also refers to compunction. no terror's conveyed when i say, "i'm afraid that i should've turned left at that junction." 
today's anthropologist traces "indigenous" customs and places. before, agriology (sans an apology) studied "uncivilized" races. 
the inspector's charisma is cresting, his men are agreed in attesting. he brooks no dissension; commands their attention. this officer sure is arresting. 
the plumber examined my pipe, then suddenly let out a yipe. "i can't ascertain what's wrong with your drain? apart from this nest full of snipe." 
old sledge, seven up, and all-fours are all names for a game played indoors. if your card's low or high you're a lucky-ish guy; get the jack, and a victory's yours. 
his passion for orchids now over, but still a committed plant-rover, steve found the agave, with spikes havey-cavey but tasty; a cousin of clover.

the apiary's where they flung us: soon hornets and bees buzzed among us. we swatted, of course, but with little remorse, they just stung us and stung us and stung us. 
arboretums are surely to please. they're gardens devoted to trees. you'll be glad that you stayed in a sun-dappled glade ? unless you're allergic and sneeze. 
"i'll transfer your land, for a fee," said the property lawyer to me. "but it's totally vital to hand me the title to give to the new assignee."

with chris getting long in the tooth, his anxiety heightened, forsooth! to live until zed, he saw up ahead: a limerick fountain of youth! 
even though, notwithstanding, albeit are phrases for when you decree it is not quite the case, when you say of a face, "it's divine," but it pains you to see it. 
amoebae don't know about sex. they've nary a muscle to flex. they've only one cell (which they think is just swell). going fission requires no pecs. 
when masculine joins femininity (mainly coupled, but sometimes a trinity), and when chemicals bind, what's the word you will find? the answer, of course, is affinity. 
their trains ran on time, this we knew; but the fascists built motorways, too. 'fore milan's autostrada, italians had nada. by fiat, benito came through. 
this limerick writing's sensational! it's truly, i'd say, inspirational! i'd do it all day, but it never would pay? i'm afraid that it's just avocational.

"to avalon arthur's proceeding with injuries, mortally bleeding." so closes le morte (a misleading report, but it makes for magnificent reading). 
when your inquiries run in a line or your street's of a spacious design, what you have is an avenue. (there, now i have a new word that i needn't define.) 
in a pound, count the ounces you eat; in an ounce, count the drams that you meet. just imagine the joys using avoirdupois if it's sixteen you're after ? it's sweet! 
captain nemo, with some of his friends, down to two thousand fathoms descends. he promises, "this'll be truly abyssal." returning, he'll suffer the bends. 
amoebiasis sounds so contrary: it's when you contract dysentery. amoebae go nuts way down deep in your guts and you fear that they'll stay and make merry. 
the aristarch brooked not a snag; at each typo, he'd hoist a red flag. his critical shrewdness struck others as rudeness: his slagging, they thought, was a drag. 
long before epicurus professed, "live for now; let your lust be the test," aristippus made pleasure his primary measure, expressing the blessings of zest. 
for a hundred and thirty-two years other yachtsmen were grinding their gears, then at last, time was up for america's cup, and the aussies responded with cheers. 
a ward of the state as a tot, then a government pension he got. when his last breath he draws, alimentary laws will provide for his burial plot. 
a maiden in wales wished to wed, and the thought filled her father with dread: for the amobyr loomed and this tax, he assumed, would betoken privation ahead. 
the aficionado will shout that his fondness for fish is devout. for myself, i just wish he would stop! ain't it fishy, this ardent obsession with trout? 
venezuelans, and not japanese, see above, in the branches of trees, araguatos a-prowling and ceaselessly howling: no monkey's as noisy as these. 
arakan for millennia thrived, then the mughals with muskets arrived; and with chittagong gone it just couldn't hold on, but its buddhist pagodas survived. 
the baby reached out for some more, but his mommy said, "kid, here's the score: agalactous, my teats have no milk. for your eats try this formula, fresh from the store." 
his graphing ability's lax; he's all tangled in minis and maxis. the curves are awry between x, z, and y: he's convinced of the evil of axes. 
again-sayers never repeat what another guy utters. they greet each assertion with sneering and bellicose jeering: disdainful complaining's their beat. 
aymara ruled the andean plain, but succumbed to the incas, then spain. they remain in peru (where they made their debut) and bolivia, once their domain. 
to swim in the sea with a man who isn't her husband; to fan the flames of her passion with painting and fashion: awakening starts with chopin. 
when some boys bought my bossies, it cost 'em. my peewees and agates? i tossed 'em. my alleys, i've found (alabaster, and round); but the rest of my marbles? i lost 'em. 
so skinny and fat-as-a-sow have agreed to amalgamate now. for fat's share of beef stock, lank traded its leaf stalk; they milked all the cash from the cow. 
on a stem, where the foliage grows, is the axil, my gardener knows. it doesn't sing songs for the metalhead throngs; it's an angle where roses repose. 
a devonshire chemist named scruggs carries carpets along with his drugs. with their fake-turkish piles in all colours and styles, i shall ax for his axminster rugs. 
steve's botany lecture was yawnless. we learned that some grasses are awnless, like brome (but not thistles): they lack any bristles. i'd check, but my garden is lawnless. 
a belle with a buxom behind and with manners sublimely refined, will stifle a bristle when gentlemen whistle, and answer, "you're awfully kind!" 
the aitchbone's a cut of a steak that's great with some fries and a shake. the "aitch" ain't for "hearty" or "hey, folks, let's party"? it's shaped like an "h," for god's sake! 
bloviation poured out of his spout, so i took my anemograph out and i measured the speed of his hot airy screed: twenty bromides a minute, about. 
an actor who's hard to replace performs with decorum and grace. he expresses devotion with heartfelt emotion and wears an aspectabund face. 
though they're small from their heads to their tails, the alburn (a fish) never fails to amaze us with making white pearls, but it's faking: they come from its silvery scales. 
an ascetic is someone who tightens his belt; but not so with ascitans. they dance in a hearty heretical party, since wine, they imagine, enlightens. 
the coiner confessed to the thief, "all my counterfeits filled me with grief. then i found some machines that strike pictures of queens: anaglyptographs?what a relief!" 
since i'm feeling, today, pedagogical, i'll teach you the word allobrogical. it means calvinist, from allobroges, who'd come long before to geneva: how logical!

when observing the fourth of july, uncle sam ate a warm apple pie. he proceeded to blurt, "it's a british dessert!" miss american pie's gonna cry. 
i rashly attempted to trammel a beastly arabian camel. i jumped on its hump, and got dumped on my rump? only chumps try to mount such a mammal!

while ayring his acres near ayr, the farmer (a scotsman) took care to finish by dark, and then, on a lark, he ayred to the square on his mare.

anatolian languages spread when cuneiform tablets were read. there was hittite-palaic (but not aramaic) and other ones, equally dead. 
as a poet, i've now reached my acme. and if versemongers scruple to back me in my claim to be best i have just one request: since i've no other skills, please don't sack me! 
fear not! here goes nothing, say i. ask not, await not my reply. it's not a catastrophe, it's only anastrophe: syntactically, slightly awry. 
to prognosticate, wood-cutting souls would take hatchets, and heat them on coals. like divining from tea, axinomancy told the future. (today, we use polls.)

every paleontologist knows that the temperature suddenly rose in the aptian time? the iguanodons' prime and the sauropods' vanishing throes. 
to windhoek, the farmers bring maize, and the co-op they bring it to pays. with their agsterskot paid, all the boers have it made, 'til another year's harvesting days.

if the bill-paying baltimore oriole (personality: somewhat censorial) thinks a team in dc should be countered, you see, he may bray in a paid advertorial. 
a connecticut yankee named hackett with epaulets pinned to his jacket sees knights wearing plates on their shoulders, and states, "those are ailettes you've got?what's your racket?" 
the circular saw, i have found, has uses that truly abound. it cuts timbers with tangles and miters at angles? i'd say, as a tool, it's all-round. 
an emmanuel student, darius, disported an aulary bias. all things apropos of his hall made him glow: his devotion to emma was pious. 
my cat, in the summer, was parched, so across to his saucer he marched. but my dog (what a nerve!) got there first?what a curve on the back of my cat as he arched! 
the clerk, though inclined to be affable, lost patience, presented with laughable instructions to wire the romans in tyre. he cried, "but they're untelegraphable!" 
"my students," moaned steve, "aren't attentive. i need to provide an incentive." so he gave them some seed from a naturalized weed. "marijuana," he said, "is adventive!" 
i demand a complete explanation for my portraitist's odd innovation: i look like a ewe! though i'm sheepish, it's true, i won't stand for this agnification! 
an aristo named bartleby bourne returned from his holdings, forlorn. his estate, once a grand aristiferous land, now produced not a smidgen of corn.

while a melody played all alone might be nice on a flute or trombone, an accompaniment (where assistance is lent by some harmonies) makes it well known! 
akeratophorous ruminants lack any antlers arrayed in a rack. so the bactrian camel, a practical mammal, makes do with two humps on its back. 
the entrees at bistro giotti are sometimes a little bit spotty. the pasta they fill with some meat makes me ill: it's called "spam, spam, and spam agnolotti." 
perversely, you testify tersely, contesting suggestions adversely. i mutter, "oh mercy, you're so arsy-versy! endure it, for better or worsely!" 
the cream of the aeroplane set all yearn for yvette's aviette. when she hops on her glider, they gather beside her then roar, as she soars like a jet. 
"i'm certain it's elvis who's snoring so loudly it's shaking my flooring": epistemic, this whim. "well, it's possibly him": that's alethic (it's true, but it's boring). 
the ancients divined by default, casting crystals aloft for gestalt. alomancy provided the clues that resided in brine, a solution of salt. 
the afridi in pakistan dwell, and were prone, 'neath the raj, to rebel; they reside near the khyber. to a wisden subscriber, afridi's a bowler as well.

anthropologists know they've revealed an old hominid burial field when they pick up a dead aphanozygous head, with its cheeks 'neath its eyebrows concealed. 
autoxidation, a chemist will swear, causes brownish-red flecks here and there. if you tell her it's just the formation of rust, she'll say, "yes, through exposure to air." 
if you find that your engine's awry as your copter descends from the sky, let the airflow impel your propeller: it's swell to give autorotation a try. 
take aluminum, cobalt and nickel; add iron and copper (a trickle). it's magnetically active (like women, attractive: but alnico isn't as fickle). 
the monopolist needed a sedative; the trust-busters' cries were repetitive. "your market share rose when you bought all your foes; in a word, you are anticompetitive!" 
a scotsman, wassailing on bute, raised his rye to the sky, in salute; when from out of his flask popped a slithery ask. he ran after the newt, in pursuit. 
an astronaut whistled a tune in an areocentric saloon. he'd landed on phobos, on tour with los lobos, far off on a small martian moon. 
a toymaker, needing a topper, puts arsedine leaf where it's proper. it's gold, but it's dutch (doesn't cost half as much): it's an alloy of zinc mixed with copper. 
what's aselline? here's one sort of answer: two stars near the manger, in cancer. it also, alas, can describe a small ass (in a field, not attached to a dancer).

the aumil who came to his farm caused the indian peasant alarm. a third of his crop was a lot off the top? seven bushels, a leg, and an arm.

a worry-prone groupie named beth wrote to sting, "if you take every breath, you'll asphyxiate us? which would not be a plus! but regardless, i love you to death!" 
the atocha, with treasures galore, held cargo worth markedly more than atocha, a grass, but it foundered, alas, on a key near the florida shore. 
a pheromone yields a reaction causing intraspecific attraction. when one species entrances another, the chance is an allomone's part of the action. 
applicative means, off the bat, something easily used, like a gat in a gangster's right hand, or the strong rubber band 'round the violin case where it sat. 
when he plummeted over the cliff, he was terrified, frightened, agliff. though the road runner's fine, 'tis the end of the line for sir wile e. coyote the fifth. 
a famine's a harrowing blight for a baby to suffer. the plight of starvation consumes, and athrepsia looms: to survive's a perpetual fight. 
the mate-seeking moose, i maintain, grows deciduous bones near his brain. every year they get shed from the top of his head, then it's antlers aweigh once again. 
the pole-sitter, coping with stress, took the high road and met with success. all his apical sitting was better than flitting around, ever under duress. 
my realtor, wilfred b. wrong, sold me acres of land for a song. when next i buy acreage alongside a lake ridge, i'll ask him which side it's along.

for some people, a blotch or a canker can result in more copious rancor than a sordid affair or a fake head of hair: for example, a tv news anchorman. 
if beset by a chest-thumping swell who demands i say "uncle," i'll yell, "to propitiate you i'll avunculize, too: see, i'll act like an uncle as well!"

my sister is sometimes flirtatious? at times, she gets downright audacious. she'd cloyingly say to a man made of clay, "oh, you're really just too argillaceous!" 
geology's earliest eon? the era we call the archaean. stromatolites tarried in rocks, which they buried some ancient sublimestone debris in. 
at ascot the horses all trot, and a gentleman gambles a lot. as the stakes ascend higher, he starts to perspire and loosens his neckerchief knot. 
they're salty and smelly as sin, with slippery, slithery skin. if they're placed on a plate, by your cats they'll be ate. that's why anchovies come in a tin. 
i wish all this rain wouldn't fall so; it's driving my nerves up the wall so. a deluge of dogs is drenching my togs, and cats are cascading down also. 
suspended, their axles can go off the road, through the wooded plateau. when they see mitsubishis, endangered plant species think all-terrain vehicles blow. 
assertedly, elvis is dead? but according to something i read, he's alive. don't you trust all those doubters; you must read the national enquirer instead. 
as a teen, i had never been kissed. then a girl took ahold of my wrist, and she said, "dearest tim, please stop looking so grim! if you'd like, i'll be glad to assist!" 
persuasive contortionists use shrewd designs to make sure they won't lose. so they'll bend and they'll sway, and they'll soon get their way as their arm-twisting tightens the screws. 
although amphora sometimes referred to a jug with two handles, the word measured volume for greeks (and as jugs may spring leaks, measured less, when in rome it occurred). 
two asters are joined by a spindle; no color their junction does kindle. oh small amphiaster, divide ever faster, and never mitosis will dwindle! 
we often don't notice it's there, but at times, when we're breathing the air and it's sadly polluted by brothers who pooted, a sign should be posted: beware! 
by thousands, our limerick spree has made us quite giddy, you see. our apogee? no! we've a long way to go, as we rhyme our way onwards to z. 
"take your vitamins," doctors will say, but some drugs get in vitamins' way. to defeat your tb or leukemia, see, antivitamins enter the fray.

because he exhibits such cheek, the cat burglar's fortunes are bleak. this guy isn't furtive, he's far too assertive: a sadly self-confident sneak. 
with bottle upended, the story is vaguely anticipatory. the ketchup, once free, splatters onto your knee: in appearance, exceedingly gory. 
most kids on the last day of school find it difficult keeping their cool. then they run like all get-out upon being let out, unwound like a string from a spool. 
rousseau, condillac, and voltaire all enlightened the french, i'm aware. but in germany lessing (and herder, i'm guessing) untangled the aufkl?rung's herr.

the assistant professor complained, "i wish my adviser'd explained that you strive to get tenure, but afterwards, then you're predestined to tarry here, chained." 
when a bird uses ants for its preening, it's after their acid, not cleaning. this isn't absurd (it's called "anting," i've heard): it produces insecticide screening. 
all christians adhere to beseechings in new testament sermons and teachings. apostolic's the name that describes these; the same for the catholics describes papal preachings. 
transfusions, though often propitious, when blood types don't match are pernicious. agglutinability leads to debility: blood cells will clump somethin' vicious. 
the easterly wind on the seas allows traders to travel with ease. but the winds up above it tell sailors to shove it: the antitrades alter their breeze. 
at the carnival, dear old aunt sally, confronted with proof in the alley, proceeded to jaw with a man made of straw in a groundless-assertion finale. 
"a crime against god and the church"? with this summons my gut gave a lurch! the apparitor read it and after he said it, subjected my soul to a search.

we were snug as a bug in a rug. we embraced with a sensuous hug, but my ardor was shaken? if only she'd taken her antifertility drug!

days gone by, needful guys asked for aidance, and for digging their soil used a spadance. (the latter's not true, to be honest with you, but it fits pretty well in the cadence.) 
an  annular eclipse of the sun by the moon is a bit underdone. there's a circle of light; lunar distance ain't right, so the umbra's apparent to none. 
aplysia are snails in the sea, and each day, at a quarter past three, all these rabbit-eared critters eat watercress fritters with cucumber slices for tea.

my cousin, the chess master liam, played chess in the bronx athenaeum in shadowy nooks where they kept all the books. when he cheated, nobody could see 'im.

ahio appears more than twice (you'd think that just once would suffice), but he thrice in one book gets a biblical look. well, he's three guys, to be more precise. 
mr. lewis, the nutty professor, keeps arachis oil in his dresser (from peanuts it's made). with this gift, he'll persuade mr. murphy to be his successor. 
the amphibole lover named janet says, "this silicate's 'best on the planet'! like pyroxene but lighter, with angles much tighter, too often it's taken for granite." 
my monster instructor's particular: all chewing should be  appendicular. when you grievously harm, gnaw the leg and the arm, not the torso?that's extracurricular!

the conductor seemed not too dismayed. "some performers are tough to persuade. the guitarist is proud; if his music's too loud, i just hand him a chart to be played." 
"our music displays fits and starts 'cause we've scribbled all over the parts. on your way in the door, pick up a clean score; at last we've procured some new charts." 
"i won't say that we've made a mistake, but the market won't give us a break. going forward, each man will subscribe to this plan that charts every move that he'll make." 
the museum girl seemed so sincere. "pharaoh's mask! get your own copy here! (this cheap plaster casting won't be too long-lasting but) rates as a great souvenir!"

my career is a common-law wife ? thirty years of success and of strife. it's time to move on but ambition is gone, so i'm chained to this billet for life.

postwar europe: a crisis, indeed; show you care ? there are millions to feed. the package reveals that somebody feels for humanity, hungry, in need.

i used to let fido run free, but he's big as a big dog can be. the postmaster swore no more mail at my door, so i chained the poor dog to a tree.

there's a time a missed cycle means "frown" and you hope it's not spread around town. but when menopause hits and "the change" gives you fits, it just means that production's shut down.

calcospherite: i'd like to ask "whazzit?" but biologists ask "what can cause it?" thin calcium shells on the tissue of cells ? small orbs in an organ deposit.

capreolate plants ring my chimes, like clematis, or ivy at times. tendrils snake one by one; vines grow up toward the sun. can it be that they seek warmer climbs? 
just a shed and a red wooden table. and a sign thus: "ckpt able". "since we've barely begun, this must be checkpoint one." later on i'll continue this fable. . . .

'twas the first day to diet. i tried filching one tiny cookie.  i cried. the cellophane sheet lets me peek at the treat but keeps moisture and me from inside.

olden times, before couples were wed, courtship might have played out on a bed. the bundling board maybe prevented a baby, or possibly caused one, instead. 
i can't understand why the fuss. it's sort of conspicuous, thus: the busman's the guy right in front of your eye at the steering wheel, driving the bus. 
iron curtain: the phrase we knew well as millions' symbolical knell. you didn't dare make a false move, or the cheka would grab you and throw you in hell.

a chebyshev sounds like a thing with a tolstoy or nabokov ring. but its edge is a scarp that you'll find truly sharp ? low-pass filter of cutoff with zing. 
the frequency that you desire can be plucked from the noise on a wire. a filter, low-pass, of the butterworth class will make the performance much higher.

found some manuscripts, timeworn and rare, at an auction on christopher square. bought just one; i can't buy ya another messiah. the package reads "handel with care."

every pumpkin, tomato, and gourd had been sold; all the corn had been stored. he considered the bounty (the best in the county), knelt down and gave thanks to the lord. 
at the time, nothing major was planned: a small island, some trees, rivers, sand. a few dozen guilders made way for the builders who'd flock to this choice piece of land.

middle ages, in rome you could watch a group of singers pour forth in a caccia: painting life in the towns, or the hunt (add in sounds). did you stay for another? it gotcha! 
evolution adapting the strain at the embryo level? insane. caenogenesis, though, says new organs can grow, not hitherto seen in the chain. 
the capillary: smallest of tubes bringing blood to your tarsals or boobs. red cells from an artery feed your brain's smartery (in eggheads, much more than in rubes).

each fall as i started to school, my mom made a health-happy rule: "you know that you'd better remember your sweater. the temperature's gonna get cool." 
the citadel's strength was its size, so as harlots, ten went in disguise. 'twas a final resort for control of that fort; soon the garrison ceded its prize.

it's an odyssey history acclaims ? now it's "half-life" and similar names. it's not likely ralph baer's dreams included such heirs when he pioneered video games. 
some seeds ride the wind on their own; others, eaten by birds, will be flown. but dispersal design for the seeds of a pine has a squirrel transporting their cone. 
liftoff's over ? your rocket has flown. for your sensors, the nose is the zone. friction heat?  precious payload will never be haloed if carefully packed in a cone.

though it's surely not due to my lovin', somehow jen's got a bun in the oven. but she loves me? that's rich! that poor son of a witch she can raise with her friends in her coven. 
the catalog brimmed with seduction. "plastic surgery iv: liposuction: sucking cash in the guise of diminishing thighs is the aim of this course of instruction." 
sticky fingers will make your mom groan. no cup? don't eat ice cream alone. use the conical wafer that's edible ? safer for clothing and neatness ? a cone.

demolition is boring, perhaps: soporific, but no time for naps, for with loud detonation, to thund'rous ovation ? the crowd (and the building) collapse. 
"this (expletive!) tractor's defective!" and he showered the thing with invective. "seems nobody's manning central soviet planning, who set goals for this wayward collective."

the fugitive, brazen and bold, fled the city ? came here, i've been told. but that was last week; when the cops came to seek him, the trail had already turned cold.

a bit of spare change is a cinch: i'll write for the news in a pinch. they'll print the whole story in all of its glory ? and pay me for each column inch. 
my wife and myself ? what's the trick? sixteen years now, we've run pretty thick. it's sure not her butt or the size of my gut, but whatever it is ? man, we click!

i can't keep my senses together; i've come to the end of my tether. the sneezing, the hacking; the cough, body-racking ? this cold has me under the weather. 
over sound like a thundering hammer my voice faded off to a stammer. that guy selling shellfish? his boombox is selfish ? i can't talk at all for the clamor!

as a day trader, archibald knox felt invincible picking the stocks. so cocksure of his skill, he invested a mil: lost his shirt, plus his pants and his socks.

"of my dreams," he thought, "splendor is born," as the five stepped on stage on that morn: fulfilling his mission ? a grand composition for flute, three kazoos, and a horn. 
the artist rocked back in his chair as godiva reclined on the stair. "not bad composition, but i'm kind of wishin' you didn't have all of that hair!"

the route is a certain prediction, possessing a palpable striction. river, traffic, or horse ? will progress on its course by prescription, and not by conviction.

horn-shaped speakers called horns fill the void if high volume's the way sound's enjoyed. dome-shaped tweeters are best for your highs; for the rest, the conical cone is employed. 
for our passengers making this trip, we've a packet describing the ship. we collate in stages, then fasten the pages, and work at a pretty good clip. 
on its island along the equator, the volcano resolved to grow greater. a magma release from its core would increase the extent of the cone 'round its crater. 
i have tall piles of vinyl ? not jokin' ? like hoboken daydreams unspoken. not worthless! each platter is skeet i can shatter (some records are made to be broken). 
business methods? mine aren't the best, but our menu will leave you impressed. for the sake of expedience, we cost the ingredients and add thirty bucks for the rest. 
the cowbirds are impolite guests; in bird-world they're parasites ? pests. societal dregs, they leave all their eggs as foundlings in other birds' nests. 
the meeting's so physically small that we both fit that room down the hall. once we're seated inside, the phone gets us tied to six more, in a conference call.

one long night i was manning the board. pc problems.  there's just no reward. till a blonde hit the mark: "my computer's gone dark!" "hold it, miss.  did you unplug the cord?" 
twist some fibers together ? a string, or a rope, lace, or similar thing. cord might be a line good for tyin', or some twine, or the epaulets worn by the king. 
heavy items that move down and up may remind you you're not a young pup. so they hang from a pulley or two, balanced fully with canceling counterweights. yup!

colla voce: th' accompanist's sign that rubato or stretto's "not mine", to not play what i read: let the voice take the lead. setting tempo's the soloist's line. 
the ticket is one she can't beat: "intersection within fifty feet." i'd tried hard to warn her i live on a corner ? they won't let you park on the street. 
a singer named julian zombo saw some cash to be made in a combo. a drummer keeps pace for guitarist and bass, as they belt out the twist and the mambo. 
a copula, quick as a wink, is a verb that expresses a link: "that sounds good." "life seems free." but most often, to be, as in, "i am a thinker." i think. 
in the midst of life's moments of grief, may come something, no matter how brief, that helps us to deal with the stress that we feel ? fleeting smiles due to comic relief.

herpetologists chewing the fat note that rattlers are constant, in that, when sunning on soil, they favor a coil ? why do snakes always wind up like that?

jerry's seafood, down somewhere in dade ? clam-shaped spoons. scallop plates. table's laid. the bistro's motif? bivalve shells in relief: a conchiform theme on parade. 
common carriers often use trucks ? trains or planes make the service deluxe. they ship people, or freight, at a circumspect rate, disregarding who's paying the bucks. 
my recycler's instructions begin, "we don't want all your paper mixed in." his ads need a jingle: "plastics? metal? commingle. but paper? a separate bin."

"seen ed?" apprehension and fright drained the face of his roommate to white. i reply, "if i know ed, he's out with a coed and hopes you won't see him tonight."

here's a secret i keep under wraps: through the daytime i sneak little naps. then i get home to life with my partying wife ? i'll make midnight before i collapse.

three long years the man fiddled and fussed and, with painstaking care, carved a bust; then with sandpaper coarse and a bit too much force, in three minutes reduced it to dust.

"that new video card's for the birds!" "so says who?" "says my father, you turds!" such plain declarations may bear connotations ? what's unsaid may say more than the words.

at the jeweler's, the guy asked (dim-witted), "what size are you? ever been fitted?" not seeing this bit meant a bit of commitment, he probably should be committed. 
i used to smoke pot on the green; do some crack, not to mention caffeine. but three months in that place wiped the grin off my face, and my case? ever since, i've been clean. 
anatomically speaking, expect to find structures that interconnect. if you guess one's a cord, there's no special award, 'cause it looks like a rope, last i checked. 
professional types (engineers?) will discourse in harmonious spheres. but a body collegial, when pressed, under siege, 'll not rest with obloquial smears. 
heat your house; mix an air-fuel blend ? sense the output, then inputs amend. no need to be leery; control has its theory that's really banal in the end.

our members plant trees there and here; our funders did not disappear. we'll look at the curve and see how well our conservancy can help sustain forests this year.

i write little poems, for sale. four lines of critique ? a betrayal? for every chastushka i send my babushka, i spend three more months in the jail. 
in size, zygo's twenty-four karat. he likes seeds ? or some pastry or claret. the cockatoo's found in the places around australasia: a great big white parrot.

p-i-d provides tightest control in the fanciest tools, on the whole, self-correcting for error. you need not feel terror it's askew, when perfection's the goal. 
the cowboy lets fly his riata as far as he thinks that he otta. he misses the steeah (so would you, were you heah) and he ropes in the rancherman's dotta. 
to accumulate ticks, or keep time, a counter's the circuit sublime. be it decimal or hex, you can buy either sex, or use software, which now's in its prime.

i could think about moving to france. i could contemplate studying dance. but when lost deep in thought my mind's always caught by the dream of a first-rate romance.

from the kitchen, my wife could be heard ? "in our yard, there's this gray and white bird. from its plumage i'd say it's a canada jay." so i came, and i saw; i concurred. 
the contract discussions were dead. to the bottlers, management said in the tersest of phrases: "we're not giving raises, but just pepsi cola instead." 
i had thrown a few thou in the pot; from the split ? 3-for-1's what i got. no, i don't need thermometers or market barometers to know it's unbearably hot! 
ride the horses ? just you and your gal! family picnics ? a great new locale! we serve cheap wine in shots; there's a slide for the tots ? the chute at the tokay corral.

"listen up, men, and end your damn chatter. christian's lost, which could cost this whole matter. if contact is made, then our action's ok'ed ? else we're toast and the boats better scatter." 
have a clapbread, not really a bread ? made with oatmeal, a thin cake that's said to be "clapped out" (not batted), or carefully patted, and baked. it tastes good with a spread. 
"forget food.  i prefer fine cuisine ? 'cause the kitchen is guaranteed clean." most jokes gastronomical, if odd, droll, or comical, get laughs in my stand-up routine. 
when dancers need answers, they know choreographers spruce up the show. make a jump; the addition of second position, while airborne, is called a ciseaux. 
bistros bristle beside biscayne bay; i wish biscuits and fish on the quay. with this dish which i ask is a bisque strictly basque briskly whisked from the bay of biscay.

if your muscles are strained, overstressed, you can start out by getting some rest. an appliance caloric that's nigh prehistoric, a pad that makes heat, might be best. 
i can copy the words on a page. i can copy a stance from the stage. but success on my own? i will stumble, alone ? a pain and a bane of old age. 
our host did his best with the part ? he was cordial and warm from the start. the latin word cor says it all, maybe more, in describing it thus: from the heart. 
my boss's discourse is a code. anger wells? he can't carry the load. when approaching combustion, his language turns fustian. no question, he's primed to explode. 
"tell me, how do i know that you're you?" "lamb chops stink." words that should get him through. it's his sign, said with ease. "what's the countersign, please?" i don't want him to shoot.
perry como ? a voice that would croon a pleasant, melodious tune. he brought to society tv variety and songs, always ended too soon. 
here's a notion to ponder upon: have a vcr placed by your john. then you don't have to clap; you can laugh at the crap that never quite made it to cannes. 
there's my wall.  while i find myself hoping the cap to be suitably sloping to ward off the water, i think that i oughter top off with a sound course of coping. 
on my maps for the route i select, for efficiency, every road's checked. but no matter the graphic, the pattern of traffic runs counter to what i expect. 
the us and australia: these share a societal fabric that's rare. their peoples are blended, from comelings descended ? there are natives, but find them? like, where? 
"so my nephew is gay," said aunt kate. "a good girl's what he needs ? put him straight." (a cockamamie notion of utter emotion that's not worth a word of debate.) 
"whatcha hidin' for later?" asked paul as i dealt. "the deck's awfully small!" "i'm not cheating, you dummy! the game isn't rummy, it's conquian, gramps of them all." 
in the space used for news, as a rule, is a mural that illustrates yule ? mixing holiday mirth with the words "peace on earth," concreated at middlesex school. 
three non-aligned points will ordain a flat slice, or an infinite plane. a coplanar dot perforce is a spot that this functional set will contain. 
as my sweetheart so often predicts ? choice is scanty out here in the sticks. the kids will be pleased if they get mickey-dee'sed, for the time must be close onto six. 
it's a chancy and thankless career, dank and dirty, for year upon year. the collier mines coal so that great big brown pole will bring power to cool down your beer. 
the collier makes charcoal by grillin' raw wood till it's blackened. not thrillin'. lots of pushin' and shovin' in and out of the oven, while the man with the hives makes a killin'. 
my wife says "ah'm goin' to hale," and the cops want to throw me in jail. i may bibble a bit but i don't care one whit ? time to head to the bar for some ale. 
the bumpkin moved into the city; at each dawn, buoyed his soul with this ditty: "i'll become debonair, sport a citified air. they won't know that my home's itty-bitty." 
certain baseball terms need some explaining. one fielder's a gymnast by training; those skills are a match for a circus catch, natch, which the fan base finds most entertaining. 
for my upcoming trial i'll need help from one bonny lawyer, indeed. which says nothing of beauty, rather skill in his duty. (but should he become she, i'll accede.) 
to the trade shows for autos, each year, comes a concept car, looking most queer. this future edition won't come to fruition: its features will cost something dear. 
at the caucus, the outlook was clear ? our candidate's drive dropped a gear. but he took to the phone in conciliatory tone, "my congrats! let's move forward from here." 
rivet clinch nuts in parts you're supplying if sheet-metal screws keep on dying. it's a nut that's consigned to where access is blind (and you won't cut your fingers off trying). 
modern software is network-compliant 'cause much is completely reliant on data, remote, to keep it afloat; to the server it's known as a client. 
"all those tools that at one time were plugged to the wall have gone cordless,"  i shrugged. twelve-volt motors allow portability now ? and extension-cord salesmen are bugged. 
every day you see lights on a pole. red means "stop"; green says "go"; you've a role: they allow you to go, or they stave off the flow; called on-off, it's your basic control. 
there are boilerplate speeches, pre-planned; then the programs as played by a band; from a playbook, a page, or a shtick on the stage; predetermined and practiced, they're "canned". 
"forest 32a" was a bust. they went back to the huddle, nonplussed. but the guy on the mike kept on blathering, like endless commentary must be a must. 
"3 am on the freeway" ? a graphic that spawns an expression seraphic; cars gracefully merge where the on-lanes converge, an effortless concourse of traffic. 
two impoverished substitute teachers shared a house bearing bungaloid features: not pretentious at all, more the smallest of small, but a mansion ? for poor country preachers. 
never giving opponents an inch, winning basketball games is a cinch. about twelve should be plenty ? we won't need near twenty ? for championships we should clinch. 
i carefully placed a connector on a lead-in that tapped the collector. my transistorized toy was now prepped for my ploy ? plugged it in to my girlfriend and wrecked her. 
i've a bipolar junction transistor i got from my girlfriend's big sister. i connected its base to a sensitive place ? and now i'm unbeaten at twister. 
have a medical problem to tame? try dementor ? remember its name! but beware! things can worsen ? bein' pregnant, or nursin', contraindicates use of the same. 
it's as plain as the nose on your face, or as dull as a turtle apace ? a commonplace word, but it's rather absurd: we eschew any comma in place. 
for right-angle gouging, just watch: corner chisels will form the right notch. a specialty tool ? if you own one, you're cool. do the job that a fool's sure to botch. 
there's a lock in the knob of your door. it's a stock type of lock, nothing more. a key with its ridges moves pins a few smidges, and spins the cylindrical core. 
in the glacier are strata galore that the scientists wish to explore. going in's a bit chill, so they get out their drill, and extract a nice sample ? a core. 
when the membership starts to grow strong (which is what you'd conceived all along), the cadre, or core, will assist you before all the rookies do things that go wrong. 
though you've made a good case that it might look like open-and-shut, black-and-white ? though your premise holds promise, my nickname is thomas; you'll have to convince me you're right. 
the convict was sent to the pen so he'd never cause trouble again. lock him up, toss the key, till the king sets him free ? life was simpler, some ways, way back when. 
the appliance that's known as a popper has a vessel for corn, like a hopper. oil's heated (or air) to pop popcorn. take care to add butter and salt, to be proper. 
it's a post on the deck, or a pair, with a lintel, at times. now take care to bitt a strong cable: exceedingly stable, this mooring, or towing, affair. 
up in maine, stayed at one of their inns ? smallish room, and the bed set is "twins". "does the common room hold any lure for the old?" said the clerk, "eight's when bingo begins." 
a denominator's what is divided into numbers or entities cited. if its concept befits random disparate bits, then it's common, and neither is slighted. 
find the tenderest flesh, so discreet in diaphanous film, such a treat; by this carpel excited, my craving's requited: a segment of citrus, how sweet!

mumlock jones said, "i'd bet my last dime that ? these murders? there's only one slime. let me colligate acts by the similar facts that were found at each scene of the crime." 
pound black pepper and garlic, a treat of a relish for chicken i eat. but i'm truly confused ? in a mortar contused, how does one say it cannot be beat? 
i fix faucets and high-pressure showers; get parts from the stockroom at bauer's. no matter my needs, the counterman pleads, "i'm backed up. please come back in two hours." 
there's a theory that cash will down-trickle; for its value i won't give a nickel ? conceptually grand for the few in command, but the masses below? in a pickle. 
a classic of music lives on, be he mozart, or kern... elton john. some stars make me vomit; no sweat. like a comet, big flash ? looky looky! ? they're gone. 
mr. smith's a bit crackers; here's why: "flat earth" is a concept he'll buy. he clings to the notion that, somewhere, the ocean has edges. he'll sail off and die. 
the dutch carved the world a fine treat: handmade clogs for the bogs and the street. wrought from willow, the klompen are handy when trompin' through tulips, and easy on feet.

herb's new opus in f starts pesante; on page two, moves to soothing andante. then with zest and with zing forged to make the house sing, it concludes in a rousing brillante. 
ray removed his toupee amidst stares. "didn't mean to be putting on hairs." with a line so outrageous, their laughter's contagious ? the dominoes fall off their chairs. 
as the fault he divined grabbed attention, an idea in his mind took dimension: a concept, a notion that starts things in motion and eventually leads to invention. 
the word caulome's not of my inventance; you say "column"? you owe some repentance. of a plant's stem (in fact, sis): it's the structure, or axis. dare you now use this word in a sentence? 
there are products that oft can be found with a search; but in time, pound for pound, for results unassailable, go commercially available: it beats yard sales and such, all around. 
on tv is a sweet-talking guy: "we have bargains galore, don't be shy! what's the problem? what is it that puts off your visit? next time you're in town, please come by!" 
at least three hundred pounds, maybe greater, walt still fancied himself as a skater. "for your speed to improve learn the bunny hop move." so he tried. now the rink has a crater.

take a hamlet or town, something small. as it grows, for defense, build a wall. this aggrandization bodes citification, like shops spreading out to a mall.

any kid, playing fast, running hard, minds the clothesline that's strung in the yard. thus an arm to the neck is to clothesline, a check that in football, at least, has been barred.

our schedules are synchronized so that the treatment's on pace, and we'll know we have cinchonized mary, a girl with malaria? dosage must reach a plateau. 
doubled text, on one page, face-to-face, called a chirograph. words in the "space"? no mysterious riddle ? when cut in the middle, a contract two men could embrace.

antique fashions among the well-heeled had the bongrace, a brimmed hat (a shield), to provide some protection for eyes and complexion; from sun was a lady concealed. 
the alchemist said, "well, it's hot. to the crucible, next add the shot." it's time for cibation: that's feeding a ration of stock to the mix in the pot. 
coats-of-arms? mine goes back a long way. if my family seal you survey, you'll remark that the shield lies atilt in its field; we're not drunks ? angled shields are "couch?". 
it was petrograd, always, for her. to the end, she wore garments of fur. my babushka, last year, passed away ? grandma dear.... that image, may time never blur.

he's the chief of the largest of tribes; all the rest heed the law he prescribes. but a few earn some perks with a method that works: bringing wampum and women as bribes.

please forgive a critique that's not bidden, but with clutter this painting is ridden. though my mind could be jogged by this work, it's too clogged with distractions; the point's deeply hidden. 
"one small point on my last illustration: i would offer a clarification. i make no pretense; if my words don't make sense, let them match your exact inclination." 
"take these pills; you'll be fifty pounds thinner!" "read this ad! you're a guaranteed winner!" you'll find yourself peeved if such claptrap's believed ? someone else will be eating your dinner. 
it's an obvious pun stated here, that the color of water is clear. suspensions need cleaning ? water's clarified, meaning we make what's opaque disappear. 
i conferred with my candidate son. "i'd been sure this election was won with no way to go wrong!" "well," he countered, "i'm strong on the issues. but character? none." 
to conspire: to develop a plan ? one requiring that more than one man help in plotting its ways through the strategy phase. this is how fishing weekends began. 
finished painting, i gave her a wink. "the room's done ? tell me, what do you think?" "this color called coral looks somewhat immoral, like body parts, orangey pink." 
my language will make your hair curl. i lift weights, guzzle beer, and hunt squirrel. i believe i'll contend (and prevail in the end) for the title of "manliest girl".

jane peered below decks and she thought her dad's boat was aslosh.  what a daughter! it looked like a sump, so she bought him a pump to ensure that the bilge not have water. 
of the compound called coumalin, used once in rat poison, be disabused. electroluminescence finds this liquid the essence of filtering light thus diffused. 
free electrons, if mobile enough, make conductors of crystalline stuff. the current will swoosh with a bit of a push when some voltage applies huff and puff. 
in my judgment, lou's wholly unsuited: check out this result he's computed. his logic consists of oblique turns and twists in a path one would call convoluted. 
in the channel, beginning your voyage, you will note, port and starboard, the buoyage: a system of floats for safe passage of boats; to the fish, though, a source of annoyage. 
it's agreed, as the norm, as three years for the timeframe when jesus drew cheers. but a bipaschal scheme, to a few, it would seem, fits in "baptized" to calvary's tears.

when your sibling falls down, scrapes his knees: "mommy, mommy! it hurts! fix it, please!" with a cotton ball, mother can swab baby brother; disinfection protection's a breeze. 
collectibles: things of a kind such as hummels, or teapots you find. but the space that they use gives my sweetheart the blues, so it's coins to which i've been inclined.

alkalimetry uses a base of known volume ? a pint, or a trace. whether potent or placid, it reacts with an acid, thus measuring strength, either case. 
got a note via post this past week: foreign letters, a message oblique. they're cyrillic, i bet ? looks like russian ? and yet, from the postmark, it ought to be greek.

jagged starbursts of pain felt since birth pressed his mind to ask, "what's it all worth?" he took extra pills meant to lessen his ills and came close to departing this earth. 
"cost-of-diesel has frightful effects on the balance sheet," freddy reflects. "a freight train's the ticket to value that's slick. it will pay us to use csx." 
think those 78s don't survive? take the a train along for a drive. a big band's still a thriller. in the mood for glenn miller? the dorseys? the '40s were live! 
an adder of bit-length notation is an ex-or, in basic formation. but when "1" and "1" marry, they output a carry that's summed in the next combination. 
watch the civil rights movement unfold in the '60s, in carmichael's mold: "though the reverend king tells us 'peace' is the thing, we'll not beg for black power we hold."

a beggar of fame and renown plied the byways of old london town. toss a tuppence his way, he would hound you each day till he'd touched you for more than a crown. 
every flight has a prefix ? a code ? on the number the airline's bestowed. cx is specific to cathay pacific: and so into hong kong we rode. 
"think the law might become your life's journey?" posed a musically gifted attorney. "don't give up the travail; squaring justice's scale ? ups and downs ? asks as much as did czerny." 
in a cave mostly damp, moist, and dank, lived a poet of less than first rank. "rank's right," sniffed one reader. "his word choice and meter? my nose knows a rose, and this stank." 
since he heard i was into cross-dating, my girlfriend's big brother's been waiting. archeologically sound, a site's age can be found using similar sites and equating. 
shares of stock and the corporate game are too much for small owners, they claim. save taxpaying twitches as a dba, which is "doing business as" . 
cw, if you should ask, is the tried-and-true tack for a task. such wisdom, conventional, worthy of mention, 'll save you a reach for your flask.

steamy jungles, the city of nome, endless plains (where the buffalo roam); an anthill, the sea, or the trunk of a tree ? each has denizens, calling it "home". 
the word spam has an odd derivation, which is one way to prompt conversation. if i tell you its start, though, i won't seem so smart, so i'll say simply "pythonization". 
punctuation's the squiggles and dots that shows us what's what, or  "what's watts?" it designates pauses and specifies clauses, or, pointing, is calling the shots. 
i'm the choice, were the choice to be mine, though this mission is hard to define. if i fit, could you see fit to designate me? or, rephrasing, to send me, assign? 
the last day, christian wallowed and wailed, "i just checked on my grades and i've failed. who'd have known that diff e would have netted a 'b'? my plans for perfection? derailed!" 
i've a pistol i keep out of sight, a derringer, tiny and light. no blast-you-out rocket, it fits in my pocket ? my block's somehow safer at night. 
'68, with the protesters, fuzz. '69, on the moon ? neil and buzz. in the cbs fort was the cronkite report. and that is the way that it was.

lost my wad, and my shirt, but i feel, with excitement that's hard to conceal, next hand's mine; don't remind me these cards are unkind. i will win if i stay one more deal. 
i could not have foreseen this scene coming ? two bottles, four girls, youthful plumbing. in my nineteenth september, one night to remember, a debauch that for weeks kept me humming. 
rags of sail flutter, flap, in the breeze, as the derelict sinks by degrees ? abandoned, forgotten, and nearly half-rotten. neglect is a yacht's worst disease. 
in a bar sat descartes, one fine night. said the barman, attentive, polite: "would a beer be your tot?" said ren?, "i think not," and he instantly vanished from sight. 
now you're calling me names?  well, that's splendid. i'd retort were i truly offended. i won't stoop so low and demean myself so, when debate had been what i'd intended. 
he has no philosophical vision; votes are cast, born of rank indecision. thus studious ways and a faraway gaze draw the scoffs, sneers, and mocks of derision. 
our town said it's planning to cite us as an eyesore ? they're fixing to fight us over one plastic bag... a small mountain of slag. oh.  junk cars.  and some other detritus. 
try our deli, "italian delight"! fresh pasta with clams, red or white! select an ideal delectable meal to tickle your taste buds, tonight! 
re: the old derry area choir ? it's a name that will hardly inspire. i feel like a chump every time i think "rump", but their singing i have to admire. 
i must plot for a shot (i've been schemin'), or my wife will dispense me a reamin'. no devil i lack: i've got one on my back and i can't rid myself of the demon. 
it's a sad day our children will greet when consumption is over, complete. they will walk home, alas, when they've run out of gas ? which is surely a pain ? in defeat. 
six atoms of c want to cling ? do a double-bond, single-bond, thing. to each leftover bond atom h will respond, making benzene, the hexagon "ring". 
the editor rose from his chair. to the playwright he said, with a glare: "though your writing is fine, you've too much in each line; please delete a few words here and there." 
the dimensions of length, width, and height are static, geometrists write. choose an angle of view where you look straight at two; the third becomes depth, per your sight. 
conservationists stand in ovation for lumberjacks' steps bring elation ? announcing a freeze on mass cutting of trees, a stand against deforestation. 
my gate to the yard out behind doesn't close right. i've looked and i find that the sun's warped the fence; in a transitive sense it deformed it, thus making it bind. 
a spring-loaded bearing will roll to a notch, or a groove, or a hole. such a detent will do for "pop in" ("pop out", too) like you've seen joining lengths of a pole. 
she urged us to make the world greener ? make it healthier, natural, cleaner. but her words, so impressive, were bluntly aggressive; we balked at her nasty demeanor. 
a milestone in jazz, there's no doubt: top 40, make room; this had clout. from paul desmond's hand and dave brubeck's band, the peak of the album time out. 
by act iii the whole problem's been solved, but the climax was rather involved. so a last little twitch: the denouement, in which all is tidied and neatly resolved.

said the boss, "i should what!? take you back? every project you drove left its track! i'll depict how you were ? you were derelict, sir ? you were negligent, careless, and slack!" 
the guy who paints stripes? running late. but the grounds and the game wouldn't wait. when the head of the crew asked, "you know what to do?" said the newbie, succinctly, "damn straight!" 
he adds makeup by light through the scrim ? between scenes goes from gloomy to grim. his memorized lines include facial designs; he can't see much, the wings are so dim. 
"go to jail. go directly to jail." forceful orders. no prayers will avail. they emphatically state that your course will be straight. strike three, called.  out of order.  no sale. 
i was told, "paint the church.  no constraints." the trustees, though, it seems, are no saints. since i finished i've heard every ungodly word; i've been deluged, nay, swamped, with complaints. 
my sweetheart and i like this band. waist to waist, cheek to cheek, hand in hand ? i hope i don't slip as i give her a dip: flip her down on my arm and then stand. 
i might worry, or fret, even brood, had i picked someone nice to delude. but the clerk on our crew is a jerk through and through, so i found a few lies to include. 
very chic? i would never have guessed faux-antique to be thought of as best. pristine lumber is marred, burned, disfigured, and scarred, to create the motif called distressed. 
the republicans' nickname would be "grand old party", or plain "gop". there are no cutesy gems for the democrats ? dems is their name on the news on tv. 
"i've made thousands, and still can't escape cutting holiday snowflakes from crepe." "well, you'll think cheating's cheesy, but die-cut is easy ? mechanically stamping a shape." 
friction-fit is the door that goes "in", but it never stays shut.  then i grin. the solution is simple ? extruding a dimple: a pit or a bump in the skin. 
"come thou hither, i prithee; be mine!" the page withers, as leaves on a vine. "your allurements, so vaunted, leave me flustered and daunted." (but your serving-maid suits me just fine.) 
find the stocks that advanced?call them a; then there's d's for declines (price decay). graph the a to d slope, predicting, you hope, how the markets will move and which way. 
the fifties had slang we should mention: some phrases of teenage invention. to your buddy or pal ('cept of course, if a gal) ? "hey, daddy-o!" got his attention. 
as a programmer, ralph's no great shakes, but he'll smoke out the errors he makes. he'll add specialized signs saying, "don't use these lines," and have commented out his mistakes. 
i went to see mom. it's no bull ? her home cooking's the kind makes me fuller. she said, "doughnuts are coming; the fryer is humming. while you wait, for a twist have a cruller. 
a lawyer on capitol hill lobbied hard, but his work came to nil. a levy he sought wouldn't come, so they thought, even close toward footing the bill. 
all those insults the players withstood; still they played the best baseball they could. but o'malley, that traitor, killed brooklyn's the-ater, dem bums moved to l.a. for good. 
in the cold, with the snow up to here, comes a doe.  as she nears, it grows clear she's a stare in her eyes ? she is blind, i surmise. shall i give her a name?  no-eye deer. 
lost a tooth in a bit of a scrap ? there's no root left to anchor a cap. so a fake one is tied to the tooth on each side in a bridge that will fill in the gap. 
acidimetry. here ? fix your head. alkalimetry first should be read. put acid in place of each instance of base; measure alkaline content instead.

thirty winters ? the span was a wreck, so a bridge engineer went to check. it needed new paint, but his major complaint was the roadbed.  "resurface the deck."
