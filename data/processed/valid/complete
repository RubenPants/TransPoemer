california and mexico boast the beach pancake.  i think it's the most pretty plant; red like wine are its flowers divine when it blooms on the dunes of the coast.

condisciples took heed of the speech of their classmate who stood up to preach: "fellow students, let's all shun these bricks in the wall in this classroom and head for the beach!"

a tedious pattern i find every day at my job.  it's the kind where i pulverize flour each hour upon hour. i'm not bred for the mill's daily grind.

her "send in the clowns" i recall, and of course "both sides now" wasn't small, and "amazing grace" too. besides these ? yes, it's true ? i don't know judy collins at all.

i would commonly catch 40 winks at my job till the boss said, "methinks someone new won't perhaps be so prone to quick naps." i'm so sleep-deprived now.  this job stinks. 
candlewasters of old stayed up late with their studies as flame would abate from a candle.  today we can study by way of a lightbulb or two.  ain't that great? 
at the bus stop, we'd wait in the rain for the bus.  people called us insane for our flirting while waiting. it led to us dating, and now, a new name she will gain. 
i met anne in the clubhouse one day. she resembles a cow.  i asked, "hey, what's your board game of choice?" thinking best not to voice: "cowy anne, what's your game?  can i play?"

"how you think, learn, perceive, recollect ? these are qualities i can detect," said my date. that's some gall! she knew pretty much all. bet my leaving she didn't expect.

this inventor, known hither and yon as the greatest, would happen upon a great notion.  that's when thomas edison then had an overhead light bulb go on. 
joey dee and the starliters played at the peppermint lounge, where they paid the place tribute in song. on the charts, before long, they'd see "peppermint twist" get top grade.

with this limerick, you're certain to learn that the ebony spleenwort's a fern with dark stalks and has ladder- like leaves.  does this matter to you?  that is not my concern. 
with my broad-based campaign, i can't lose. vast political spectrums i use to gain needed support. there's one rule: when you court a wide cross-section, tailor your views. 
my blonde girlfriend, a little bit queer, doesn't think "when day's dawning is here" is what's meant by auroral: "prefix aur-, suffix -oral pertains to you nibbling my ear." 
with dressing, a turkey you stuff; you decide what amount is enough to enhance salad taste; and this act's done in haste when you find you've been viewed in the buff. 
a collection of various kinds, oft at odds, is the congress.  what binds this assortment together like birds of a feather? a vote for a pay raise ? like minds. 
the cosmos, when reaching the max in its size from expansion, contracts. gravitational force makes all matter switch course and implode.  down the road though.  relax. 
charm offensive: a kind of campaign where one flatters, cajoles, tries to gain people's favor and trust. those in politics must use this craft so support doesn't wane. 
you're not really a brother, rg. true blackness is nowhere to see. from groupthink you stray, you've a white fiancee, and you probably vote gop. 
said nymphomaniacal gwen, "some have noted i'm deep into men some, but they estimate low ? maybe 80 or so that i've slept with.  keep going.  and then some." 
since the day you departed the scene, i've been brainsick (diseased in the bean). i'm demented and mad. any sense that i had in my head's been completely wiped clean. 
my animal nature shows through in the bedroom. you know what to do to unleash my wild beast; my libido's increased with a creaturely craving for you. 
what are coolerators?  fridges of old. kinda small, not a lot would they hold. mama food shopped each day 'cause it vanished.  she'd say, "well, at least our food never grows mold." 
"i was feeling left out," said mcguinn. "all my buddies from high school had been in the army, and so when we meet now, i go wearing camo: i want to blend in." 
my guilt got the better of me, and i had to come clean: "well, you see, truth be told, i've been keeping a secret: i'm sleeping around; it's a pre-marriage spree." 
"depressed?" said my shrink. "feeling blue?" (well, duh! aren't i talking to you?) "certain books can be healing? they'll improve how you're feeling.
" (what i feel is you ain't got a clue!)
you dwell on your failures and pout. then it falls on deaf ears when i shout all the time not to beat yourself up.  i'll repeat it no longer, so knock yourself out.

"bases loaded, two outs.  it's on me to come through," thought mcwhiff.  but with three pitches swung at and missed, the crowd booed.  one quite pissed yelled, "you're blind as a bat!  you can't see!" 
extinguished before it began was my plan to get busy with ann, the town nympho.  she shot down my notion: "i'm not putting out for just any old man."

al jazeera bought current tv, which was led by our former v.p. from a mindset progressive to anti-u.s.-ive ? no difference as far as i see. 
that empiric (unqualified hack with no obvious curative knack) on the hospital's roster is just an imposter whose license needs lifting, that quack. 
ecce homo: in art, a depiction of a thorny-crowned christ post conviction (from biblical text). we all know what came next for the man: meeting fate (crucifixion). 
i'd assist, with a kneel and a bow, with whatever the priests would allow when they gave sunday mass. but my values turned crass over time; i'm no altar boy now. 
the equals (two white and three black) combined pop, rock, and reggae.  one track by this group from great britain had fans the most smitten: the chart topper "baby, come back." 
my boyfriend's a ghost.  yes, it's true. every night in my bedroom, we screw. you think that's strange?  what's heard neath the sheets?  not a word. when he's with me, he doesn't say boo. 
the shadow he left is long-cast. his societal impact was vast. he belongs to the ages, on history's pages, indelibly part of the past. 
a conclave, in secretive cloak, meets to choose from its ranks the one bloke who will change his profession to pope.  from this session, their choice always goes up in smoke. 
i'm employed in an office.  i suffer the life of an envelope stuffer. with my duties low-grade, i'm a man who's low-paid. i can't build a retirement buffer. 
for a time, the association was great: '66, '67 & 8. this band of six men had five hits, all top ten. after that, their success would deflate. 
all alone on a see-saw sat sy, when along came a big, burly guy, who said, "i'll be your counterweight." yelling "don't mount 'er!  wait!" sy was too late.  see him fly. 
i belonged to a group that was choral. discordful, we'd frequently quarrel. at issue? my voice. seems they couldn't rejoice in god's praise hearing sounds deemed immoral. 
"do tell."  i had meant: "is that so?" my detachment i hoped didn't show. this politeness to you was misread as a cue to pour forth with more details.  oh, no! 
"i endow a blank check," so decrees my old man.  "you can do as you please. you have freedom unbound." but a jeer's what i found when i reached as he dangled his keys. 
with "speedo," the cadillacs hit, then with "rudolph."  discord caused a split into two groups, but then, brought together again, they had "peek-a-boo" chart.  that was it. 
politicians will speak in a way indirect.  it's a game that they play: an unpopular word such as tax becomes heard as investment.  they couch what they say. 
i would vote for a merchant of smut, or that guy down the street who's a nut, or my daughter who's four. get the picture?  no more of the same.  i want anyone but. 
this drink that i'm holding of brandy with sugar and lemon is dandy. but i'd much rather hold other bimbos.  i'm sold on those vacuous babes who are randy. 
a parachute jumper he's not. in this movie, no airplane you'll spot. there's no free-falling guy dropping out of the sky. that's a chutist.  this shootist gets shot. 
"per their dress code, they couldn't refuse giving service, your honor."  "you lose. something else they had meant by that sign.  when you went, you wore only a shirt and some shoes." 
though delayed, the result of us going to bed some weeks back we're now knowing. it's gonna be soon, maybe some time in june, when the aftereffect you start showing. 
"you're obese."  "mama calls me big-boned." "in my office, that term's not condoned. see the scale?  i'll be straight: you're just too overweight. cut out fats ? this helps death be postponed." 
soft rock is what cymarron played, and their one big song, "rings," made the grade when it broke through the top 20 songs charting pop; but they had no more hits, i'm afraid. 
"in my other job, i'm a recorder of things as they happened: a sorter of facts from the past from the first to the last," said the waitress who wrote down my order. 
that promiscuous daughter of yours is a nympho ? out looking for scores, always sex on the mind. any man she can find brings the prospect of dropping her drawers. 
with no jobs in my field, it was wise that this graduate thought to devise a contingency plan. i'm a practical man, not too proud.  "so with that, you want fries?" 
fine matter collects to embrace and form clouds; they're all over the place on a much higher sphere. cosmic dust we have here, so it's good there's a vacuum in space. 
my waiter is one of those guys who serves up such a sight to these eyes. now i learn that this beaut, who's deliciously cute, isn't gay, and a part of me dies. 
the congresses past can't demand that we follow what's deemed a dead hand. though each house can address and rid rules that oppress, we're all bound to one law of the land. 
from an overbooked flight, i got bumped. (it's a popular airline.)  i jumped on a later flight.  there, as we cruised in the air miles high, all us passengers humped. 
i'm part of an atheist squad of performers.  the concept is odd, as revealed in the skit where we ponder a bit, entertaining the notion of god. 
i keep cinnabar moths out in back. callimorpha are large, red, and black. they lay eggs in large batches, and when the brood hatches, on leaves of the ragwort they snack. 
power shovels dig sediment massed in the waterways where it was cast. this got me to thinkin': that city that's incan and lost ? can one dredge up the past? 
i've extremely thick lenses.  don't drink from my coke bottle glasses.  ya think? poor eyesight's my lot. it's ironic: i got new employment at pepsico inc. 
brittany spaniels have tails that are short and have coats of the reddish-brown sort or else orange and white. large and active, they're quite good if hunting for fowl is your sport. 
my discipline's history, class. that's my branch of instruction.  you'll pass if you do all the work. if the work, though, you shirk, you'll be history: out on your ass. 
this burnout? it can't be ignored. overworked? no. i'm overly bored. i just gotta break clean from long years of routine. if i don't, then just shoot me. good lord! 
i divided, bisectionally, tarts and then turned to my friend who has smarts, and i queried him, "what do we have that i cut?" he responded, "we halve equal parts." 
biosocially, forces combine. they're behind this affliction of mine. dna made me fat, though it doesn't help that it's on junk food i'm most apt to dine. 
you engage in such risky behavior: you're dancing with death.  you can wave your existence goodbye, 'cause the chances are high tempting fate means you'll soon meet your savior. 
there once was a flasher named todd who was cuffed for exposing his rod. "sorry, pal," said a cop. "if you don't want to stop, go to nudist camps: show your whole bod." 
the edsels were named for a car. like the car, they din't go very far ? just one hit, but a pearl of a song 'bout a girl with a name that is pretty bizarre. 
don't look back in the journey of life. you should learn from your troubles and strife but then put them to bed. keep your eyes straight ahead. just recall what became of lot's wife. 
"i'm alert, and i listen intently to all that occurs."  "evidently, your ear to the ground let in nary a sound as a hoodlum drove off in my bentley!" 
"at airports, what's not an okay word is checked," i informed my kid hayward. "your bag should go in a plane's overhead bin. son, a carry-on doesn't go wayward." 
when infants go poo or go pee, they get changed.  your mistake, my ch?rie, is to try to wipe clean any "flaws" that you've seen in attempts at refashioning me. 
"there are forces at work," said our pastor. "a plan was designed by our master. it's in full operation. one of marked deviation, care of satan, will lead to disaster." 
i committed a criminal act. an accessory after the fact, uncle lou, thwarts the fuzz in my capture.  my cousin (his kid and a blab threat) was whacked. 
i repeated, "co-boss!" to my cows, summoned in from the pasture, and now's when they gather inside as i'm standing with pride next to bessie and saying my vows. 
i can't go to this evening's affair. be my eyes and ears, please, while you're there. report back to me what you hear and you see. the more juicy, the better to share. 
"the buck stops with me," so she said. except when it doesn't.  not read were the cables chris sent of the hotbed extent of benghazi.  he later was dead. 
in yesterday's bar fight, a fist smashed some bones round my eye.  i'm so pissed! blowout fractures ain't fun. an emergency run fixed me up.  hope that broad broke her wrist. 
so much blissfulness fills up our tutor. negativity doesn't pollute her. her abundance of joy is enough to annoy; it's so cloying, the class wants to shoot her. 
schooled and trained, i've a party this fall, and society's making a call. but i really don't care 'cept for bachelors there; they're who make comings out such a ball. 
"where do sexual impulses start?" asked our teacher.  some answered, "the heart." (god, how dumb!)  he said, "no. it's the brain."  i thought, "whoa! glad i didn't say, 'genital part.'" 
roger ebert reviewed the big screen with a partner named siskel, or gene. they achieved much renown with their thumbs up or down, showing worth of the films that they'd seen. 
dan cathy (top dog, chick-fil-a) leads his life in a biblical way. this christian supporter, who's taking god's order, backs marriage but not if you're gay. 
i've developed an engouement, true, an irrational fondness for you. there's no rhyme and no reason for findin' you pleasin'. i love you, my skank.  i just do. 
trees with yellow to sepia flowers and pulp with medicinal powers: canafistolas.  they have a name you might say with a smirk on your face: golden showers. 
every inch unproductive is chris at the plate.  it's a hitless abyss. he can't even produce with the gals.  it's no use. he stays dry.  every swing is a miss. 
i will treasure that evening with dawn. she had beauty to which i was drawn. but short-lived was our meeting ? ephemerous, fleeting ? one night of great sex.  now she's gone. 
seven seasons of m*a*s*h wore him down, yet it brought gary burghoff renown. folks regarded him highly as "radar" o'reilly; before that, as good man charlie brown. 
an ex-hippie i know likes to cling, and she'll constantly phone.  so, last spring i got caller id. if the name that i see shows as "freedom," i just let it ring. 
in the a block, we open with news. then we break for commercials and use the blocks b, c, and d for more news.  in block e and block f, we hear panelist views. 
by congress, a limit is set beyond which the national debt cannot rise; that's its ceiling. our maximum stealing, er, borrowing power's a threat. 
my hot girlfriend's a sight to behold, and her sex passion can't be controlled, but she also is dumb, a bananahead, numb in the skull; she's why blonde jokes are told. 
you cause excitation in me. i'm aroused as you plainly can see. you know how to make my libido awake. my ignition starts up with your key. 
an early retirement's in store, 'cause i don't have to work any more. at just forty, i'm done. at the lotto, i won. now i deal with appeals by the score.

the convention was well underway when the delegate stood up to say, "he hails from our state. yes, our homeboy is great! for our favorite son, we vote "yea." 
the government board fcc deals with radio, wire, and tv. it regulates air and the info we share, making sure they're obscenity-free.

master satan is calling on you. you're his favorite barber ? it's true ? 'cause you're keenly aware how he wishes his hair to be styled. give the devil his do.

that assembly, factitiously made, is a sham: unions staged this charade. of the "protesters" there, most are props who don't care in the least for the cause.  they were paid. 
in his sesame 18-year run, northern calloway's life came undone. as david we knew him. mental illness: that threw him. when he died, he was just forty-one. 
i'm an atheist.  church ain't my game. i will only attend if the aim of a loved one's to wed or a loved one drops dead. some may joke that they're one and the same. 
my agenda will not be impeded. unilateral action is needed. checks and balances?  pshaw. i can make my own law, the congressional branch superseded.

conservative groups they equate to a danger, no friends of the state; but the actual loons are the government goons who are keen on destroying debate. 
i was taught how to spot a good deal by my mom, but i totally feel, with small items, that i've got a better way: five- finger discounts.  they're grabbed for a steal.

these models are gorgeous ? and how! and their outfits are totally wow! i'm a fashion show nut. i like watching them strut and sashay down the catwalk.  meeeow!

my debate prep at school hit a snag. right-wing sites they apparently tag as offensive.  my side has its access denied. i showed up with my mouth in a gag. 
obama is freeing jihadis, disprisoning killers.  my god!  he's a nut!  what's he think? hatred toward us will shrink? we'll see more dead american bodies. 
i've a gal on the side.  when that cutie calls or texts me, it's always for booty calls. my oblivious wife thinks it's part of my life as a volunteer fireman when "duty" calls. 
when faced with that challenge, you ran. when life throws you curveballs, your plan should be tackling these things with the courage of kings. have some balls!  c'mon, ann!  be a man! 
to the ivies i chose to apply. were it not for my grade point (not high), a shoo-in i'd be. no such college for me: it is there but for test scores go i.

egregious, an interesting word, once meant "great," "standing out from the herd." now it's "flagrant," "deplorable," "shocking," and "horrible." an utter one-eighty occurred. 
ronnie dove hit where ballads are breezy (five top tens).  but in pop?  not so easy. rock 'n' roll, in full swing, was the happening thing. many teens, therefore, thought his songs cheesy. 
these cookies are folded and thin and have fortunes on paper within with predictions.  it seems all the time mine have themes like your life is a game you can't win. 
higher pay over time is a shame when we can't get ahead of the game. we see taxes go up with inflation and ? yup ? our real purchasing power's the same. 
my periods?  flowers, mom said. and i learned that my vulva instead was my flower.  amused by the terms that i used, my friends laughed, and my face turned beet red.

handling fish (also seafood in shells, like the cockles and mussels she sells) compels molly to spend each day's end with a friend: a nice bath (to kill fishmonger smells). 
parabolically arcing across were the chainsaws i happened to toss. what i'd planned was they'd land in the opposite hand, but i suffered a permanent loss. 
sis entered upon dad's estate: "took possession," not "passed through the gate." she was always his favorite. that's why he gave her it. sound mind?  uh... that's up for debate. 
"take a shower, my daughter," i said, "cuz we're going to grandma's."  ahead of her shower, her aim was to finish the game on her phone.  she said, "wait till i'm dead." 
the house is in gop hands and the senate now too.  this demands i make laws on my own with a pen and a phone. whatever i order, it stands.

i'm so sick of the word conversation from those who propose, as a nation, we talk.  exchanged thought and opinions aren't sought; to lecture's their prime motivation. 
in combat-engaged situations, confusion and miscalculations can happen.  the more fog of war for one's corps, the less dominance shown by their nations. 
there were times when my life saw me stray. in review with st. peter today, i made known what i'd change. he said, "god won't arrange for a do-over, son.  better pray." 
our eternal rest comes when we die, 'cause it looks like we're sleeping.  but why use this phrase?  just the body stops functioning.  god?  he takes souls to live on in the sky.

the killers seize more and more land, yet our prez thinks we're crippling their brand. what is obvious, he just pretends not to see as he buries his head in the sand.

solar times have a difference between the apparent (the true) and the mean. it is called the equation of time.  on occasion, agreement of both of them's seen.

as fledglings, we rookies were new to the scene, and we hadn't a clue how a company runs. the entrenched older guns shot us down.  in two months, we were through. 
determining ways to reduce carbon footprints, they monitor use of our energy.  audits like these don't get plaudits from companies feeling the noose.

my publicity firm's been selected, the electorate polled and dissected. while you're out on the stump, i'll be busting my hump, moving mountains to get you elected. 
because frederick accum was shrewd, he revealed degradation of food. his work for the masses on toxins and gases caused scandal, and accum was sued.

call the neighbors, the fruit's on the table, from borneo ? reeks like a stable. dig in and you'll quell the despicable smell. try durians soon (if you're able). 
on my bed's a dust ruffle: a skirt hiding bunnies and yesterday's shirt. there's a stockpile of socks and that missing black box? and some fuzzy leftover dessert. 
we raft east from the boston plateau; after rapids, we level and slow. on the buffalo national river, it's rational: free, unconfined ? let it flow. 
in the cabin, the pilot stays calm, handling issues and scrapes with aplomb. folks from business to coach find the final approach like returning for christmas with mom. 
the red on the barber's white pole that sits on a blood-letting bowl: is he feeding his leeches on clients, while each is re-trimmed ? their original goal? 
once, she hopped on a steamer to rome, then she secretly sledded to nome, so my blacksmith down south forged a bar for her mouth. her new curb bit helps keep her at home. 
the pines in the barrens grow stunted in jersey, where dad and i hunted. we'd rest and uncoil midst the poor, sandy soil. did we chat? mostly muttered and grunted. 
evil night visions shock me from slumber: i've turned purple, enshrouded in lumber. my dream books peruse them, decode them and use them: "this is that and that's this ? here's your number." 
some in boston just couldn't adjust and objected when students were bused to halt racial division ? a noble decision, but the upshot was rage and mistrust. 
they're performed with both courage and flair, all these buildering feats of robert. he will scale any tower with consummate power. alain's un succ?s solitaire. 
the coolers were crammed for a feast, full of soda pop, slaw and roast beast and cheeses and beer and salads, i hear, and some ill-defined glop from the east. 
after midnight, you keep the talk light. and the noon slot ? just choose your words right. but a drive time appearance takes guile, perseverance, as commuters head home for the night. 
the thing with containerized cargo: stuff inside might elude an embargo. just to check every box on its blocks at the docks is a task that would bankrupt wells fargo. 
it's a down-at-the-heels place to stay, where the johns and the prostitutes play: the carpets are bumpy, the mattresses lumpy, and the towels are threadbare and gray. 
he was cornered, he saw with chagrin, as the enemy swiftly closed in. though he looked to each side, he found nowhere to hide. he just prayed he'd escape with his skin. 
most insults fly over me, mac, or they roll off my short-but-sweet back. but you called me a "gnome." that hit too close to home. gird your loins for low-level attack. 
i went shopping for just the right tool. i'd tried baking; my bread wouldn't cool. said a clerk, with a smirk, "would this cooling rack work?" it does. and i feel like a fool. 
once i loved how we used to entwine. now she's more like a tight, clinging vine, needing too much attention. she's past comprehension, but one thing's for certain: she's mine. 
i'm laid up with a mean case of gout in a dead zone ? my cell phone is out. bored to death without calls, i've been climbing the walls. this is clearly what hell is about. 
my employees are getting too bold. no more "maybe" ? they turn me down cold. they used to be pliable: overtime? viable. unions! expansion's on hold. 
some cinnamon-topped apple snow is my choice when i start to feel low. it's an apple meringue; add some lemon, and?bang! i turn young?it's a long time ago. 
i won't ask you to stay here all night with me. just support and accept me: don't fight with me. i don't need your applause; i approve of this cause. it's a purpose, a goal that sits right with me. 
she's cerebral?no half-baked buffoon, and her motives are hard to impugn, but she's faced with new facts, so her certainty cracks. now she's graciously changing her tune. 
decorum's been sliding downhill, and the atmosphere's charged with ill will: graphic threats fill the air mixed with cries of "unfair!" guess the unions don't care for this bill. 
she turns back, so we have to retrace? goes to ground, then pops up in our face. we're outfoxed and outrun; she's the one having fun. clever vixen's enjoying this chase. 
her charms put me flat on the deck: so enchanting, she left me a wreck. then this sweet mademoiselle sealed the deal with a spell that she cast with that charm 'round her neck. 
salting herring is one daunting task: wooden daunts top the fish in the cask. we press down on the slats to compact the wee sprats. does it smell? aye, 'tis best ye don't ask. 
you all backed this design at the start. now it's clear it was no work of art. still, it doesn't seem fair that it's my cross to bear. just accept it; we all played a part. 
he shipped out, and we smothered our tears, never sharing our heartache and fears. now he's home, off the bus? there are hundreds of us. he's returned to a chorus of cheers. 
with circumstances sliced to the bone, her man's gone, so she struggles alone. she needs clothing and heat, and a girl's got to eat, so she sins, but she's holding her own. 
this journal won't deal in brutalities, morality, crime or legalities. a huge national debt? we prefer to forget, so we'll chronicle life's trivialities. 
prairie pioneer, betsy from pike dared the distance with lover man, ike. were they living in shame? does this sully her name? she's iconic ? believe what you like. 
"stop your gambling!" came straight from her lips, so i'll stop ? the next solar eclipse. since i'm winning and winning, it can't be i'm sinning. with each hand, i keep stacking more chips. 
would he hit? we had reason to doubt: so much strength, still he kept striking out. we'd been pretty dejected; one day he connected. since then, he's hit clout after clout. 
in a coma for so many years, coming home now to changes and fears, feeling lost, till her brother and she hug each other, she breaks down and dissolves into tears. 
this trained ape at my local saloon is billed as "the crooning baboon." his cacophony's awful ? so bad it's unlawful! it's a shame he can't carry a tune. 
"i can clean out those stables," he crowed. "i'll just rewrite the whole penal code." "oh, come off it," i said, "you're in over your head. that's one truly herculean load." 
students love him: he's brilliant and fair. he's dynamic and listens; that's rare. but he'll leave us this year, so to draw talent here, in his name, we're endowing a chair. 
enhancing the subsoil's formation takes a very complex combination, from gardeners to moles, digging tunnels and holes for terrestrial bioturbation. 
deep-sixed many miles out at sea? food for fish, and his soul can go free. i suppose we all know that his god willed it so. now a show trial's just not gonna be. 
he just grumbles and gripes in his room ? lights out, like he's back to the womb. he's long been a skeptic, now deeply dyspeptic, choleric and cross in the gloom. 
my dad isn't ruled by the trends. he contends that contentment depends on controlling temptations, loving all god's creations, and a circle of trustworthy friends. 
with a grandeur that just couldn't fail, like a cloud she approached, under sail. there was never a doubt: every man jack turned out, the ship's company lining her rail. 
i received a citation today? no reward, but a summons to pay. i love driving too fast, but they caught me, at last. i'll remit, or they'll cart me away. 
nothing left after losses at poker; i tried flattery, hoping to stroke her, but she fed me my horse and she filed for divorce. oh, those afterclaps ? maybe i'll choke her. 
i do not run a confidence game. that's a put-up job, slander, a frame! there'll be no vacillation? it's my reputation. from this moment, i'm clearing my name. 
so i say, "the wife's gone until five. come with me: come on up; come alive!" then she turns, "wait a sec ? once again, you're a wreck. look, you're blitzed, so you're not fit to drive."

after akron, ohio's good years come the vultures, the state's auctioneers: gone most rubber and matches, come the wreckers and latches, while the blight of the rust belt appears.

"watch out," we warned charlie, "she's bleeding you dry. your yvette's slowly leading you into the red." but then charlie just said, "it's a blast. i'm not brooding; we're breeding." 
for once, the form gave me a voice. the instructions read: "circle your choice." said the boss, "don't be shy." then i saw it nearby, so i strolled all around a rolls-royce. 
i'm freaked out by this change in your mood. take a walk, man; get dressed ? eat some food. first you ditch a good job, then turn dark and macabre. see a shrink, man; you're coming unglued. 
a cop shouldn't act like a jerk, but a few show up drowsy and shirk. soon they're parked and "regrouping": clandestinely cooping ? taking naps when they should be at work. 
one pin's what you'd like me to sell you? be glad to help out, but i'll tell you (i mean no disregard): pins are sold by the card. cards are cheap, though. this oughtn't repel you.

i'm a member for three seasons past, but the staff doesn't move very fast. "this stuff happens a lot, man, we just clean forgot." then they keyed in my data at last. 
when it came, there was no time to hide: our mortality rode on that tide. it claimed thousands of lives, but our spirit survives as our terrors and panic subside. 
from a bar in secaucus, one day, i was barred (with the classics i play). "enough wainright and john; no more joel ? move on! not a bar, not a note ? stay away!" 
with our donuts and coffee consumed, called to order, our meeting resumed. our officious town clerk urged us all back to work. when he chaired, productivity boomed. 
i'll be charging the jury today as to law, and to what they should weigh. it's a task i hold dear. jurors' jobs must be clear, and this judge never leads them astray.

our debate squads have fought here before: constant combat without blood and gore. once again, we'll cross swords for our humble rewards. it's impassioned, and never a bore. 
with their comments, our classic greek chorus adds more depth to the action before us: helps us follow the plot (what's important, who's not). in their absence, some dramas might bore us. 
in utero, nourished and warm, each branchial arch can transform. in a fish, it fulfills its destiny: gills. in a human, that isn't the norm. 
our growth has been slow: by degrees, not by buyouts or moves overseas. we're secure in our yields when we plow our own fields. will that change? we make no guarantees.

they all balked when i entered the race. on the stump, though, i thrived?made my case. they're convinced now, no doubting? all over but the shouting. now they'll have to get used to this face. 
these butchers were vendors on trains, or on midways or burleycue chains. pitch a rube or a dandy, sell some barber pole candy. now their memory's all that remains. 
first he stumbled, fell back at the gun, got boxed in (he had no room to run), found a gap and ran wide, had to lengthen his stride: so our boy came from nowhere and won. 
that was christy with billy, i'm sure. i could tell from her glowing chevelure. did her head of hair haunt him? (clearly all the girls want him). no, she's choice ? so much more than coiffure. 
you're consuming without intermission: acquisition succeeds acquisition. you should come to your senses and cut your expenses. take a break; reassess your position.

year by year i've more neutral connection to which losers have won the election: i'm in guam; who prevailed? my ballot's unmailed. that's my absentee voter rejection.

your presence here shows you've begun. you must speak, though he knows what you've done. you acknowledge your sins and forgiveness begins in his house. i'll confess you, my son. 
"you're in charge of the manor," i'm told, "learn our customaries well and you're gold. they record how we've done things for years?how we've run things. our past gives us norms to uphold." 
"can't control her," the captain declared. he was good, but his skills were impaired by a contrary wind, so we kept our eyes skinned for the shoals, monumentally scared. 
they held doors, let their elders pass through. a curtsy was courtesy, too. no need for incentive ? they were civil, attentive. now "sorry"'s replaced by "screw you." 
those are sentries patrolling that base; you'll never slip into the place. you've got guts, i suppose, but that skin?it just glows. please indulge me by corking your face. 
host the in-laws? i'm long overdue. now, for dinner, i'll start with a roux, add the veggies, spice, meat, then slow-cook in low heat ? my dutch oven makes wonderful stew. 
there's this weirdo disturbing my shop. i step out, try to flag down a cop. when i turn back around, the nut's covering ground like the wind, dodging traffic ? non-stop. 
"pre-owned, but in cherry condition: no dents and no decomposition? she purrs like a kitten." i'm instantly smitten? she's a cream puff (by strict definition). 
that stuff's gross, and you've just had a drink of it? it's viscous and black ? and you stink of it. you go back to that store, and you give them what for! 'cause it makes my flesh creep just to think of it. 
this slope that we've purchased is steep, but the price (you'll excuse me)?dirt cheap. though we terrace and fill, it's all inching downhill at a barely perceptible creep. 
the poor shepherd found nowhere to write  his adventure of ewes in the night. "look, i can't type this book while i lean on my crook. and besides, the damned staff's got no light." 
how she brags that she's "given three sons" to him! he calls, and she offers her buns to him. it's weird, even kinky, how he arches his pinky? when he just crooks his finger, she runs to him. 
fresh and hot? they report what you wear. glitterati feel dated, and stare, while the bloggers observe, "she's ahead of the curve." your reaction? a breezy "i care?" 
in the high place my dog and i roam, a blanket bog borders our home. while its brambles and peat can be hard on our feet, it's our xanadu, our pleasure dome. 
if you'd harness draft horses abreast, then a doubletree gets it done best. here two singletrees ride, fastened on, side by side, keeping animals equally stressed. 
what's the value of disinformation? confusing an enemy nation. feed 'em facts that ain't so so they think that they know what you're up to ? or some variation. 
once shirazi built mosques there, and stayed, the comoros prospered on trade. merchants stopped at its coves for vanilla and cloves. now it's destitute, craves foreign aid.

we moved in, feeling safe; things were good until bangers took over the 'hood. now they're pimping and dealing ? it's a harrowing feeling. friends say, "arm yourselves." maybe we should. 
now she's signed the divorce, and we're done. though i'm back at the helm, it's no fun. guess the break's not complete, like i'm moored to a cleat. but i cast off ? so why can't i run? 
it was raymond damadian's find that magnets can look where we're blind. there are unforeseen yields from their powerful fields: mris ? they're a boon to mankind.

man has altered the planet's geology? even more so with modern technology. this mark is revealed by a burgeoning field known as anthropogeomorphology. 
in chautauquas, folks sought cultivation under canvas ? idyllic location. in thousands of towns preachers, authors and clowns all held forth. what a vast operation! 
lockheed's stylish salute to the skies, she's got luxury, comfort and size. connie's apt appellation: like stars, constellation ? she's got streamlining, grace, and she flies. 
"have a drink! loosen up, guy, have two!" that's the drill if he's buoyant or blue, or the world's changing seasons. a binge drinker has reasons to drink till his whole life's askew. 
this flick has me biting my nails; the tension is right off the scales. rustling leaves in the dark, a forlorn city park, and the gore ? i eat up these old tales. 
can't believe what i picked up today: highly prized romanesque champlev?! it's a carved silver bowl, enameled and whole? and they practically gave it away. 
to the upper missouri, the crow moved from winnipeg lake long ago, raised tobacco and corn, saw their culture reborn; lived in teepees in sun or in snow. 
"cladocera, water fleas, serve no purpose." well, you've got some nerve! eating bits of debris, they clean lakes and the sea then become food themselves ? they're hors d'oeuvre. 
many brokers adore repetition. with each stock trade, they earn a commission. they acquire like hell then sell off by the bell. all this churning demands inhibition. 
there's a bend in the stream's shallow bed where the rocks can be dodgy to thread. at that turn, stay alert ? paddle hard, no one's hurt. it's all fun if you just keep your head. 
some plants attain odd "expertise," like a milkweed that breeds with such ease. pods then age, lose resilience and crack. then dissilience spreads seeds on the soft evening breeze. 
so, you think our home "screws up" your view. it could do with some brightening ? true. but this pigment, you'll see changes that; count on me. i'm repainting it alkali blue. 
please do not bite my head off for this, but i just asked your girl for a kiss. oh, don't put on a show. loosen up; she said no; she refused a few moments of bliss. 
dad's broad shoulders belied his slight form: he was strength ? sturdy oak in a storm. though he taught self-reliance, life's never a science ? dad's gone, and it hurts ? can't get warm. 
you're a swindler, a blackleg, a crook, and you've tried every trick in the book. you'd ensure that you win; beat it now ? save your skin, and just pray to be let off the hook. 
you'd like lakefront; we do understand, but we're neighbors; just ask, don't demand. this may come as a shock: you can access our dock with an easement to pass through our land. 
blanc de blanc, if you please, with my veal; it's the only champagne for this meal. i am always selective ? the right wine's my objective. chardonnay has finesse that's ideal. 
oh, that chocolate, that custard ? no fair; it's temptation that's too hard to bear. doff your diet; dig in to that finger-shaped sin. would it kill you? one single eclair? 
with one look, she'll cut  men down to size ? it's her silent reply to their lies. though she'll always fall short of the perfect retort, she'll prevail with those eloquent eyes. 
the blaze on her forehead's the source of her elegance ? doubtless, of course! that golden brown streak is entirely unique ? but i think it belongs on a horse. 
some adventure at work can be thrilling. i've pushed limits at times ? more than willing. but i just walked away from a murder for pay. i stepped back from that act: contract killing. 
these "boy singers" have all looked the same: tousled hair, the right clothes ? that's the game. now he comes down the pike with his pointy vandyke. of course, he can't sing ? what a shame! 
ursa major? not this time, not there ? in their choppers, cops fly everywhere: they're disaster support; they pursue or escort. on the job, it's a bear in the air. 
put some back in it; pull for the prize. we're tenacity, heart ? they're just size. time we settled the score from our last tug of war. with each pull, look them right in their eyes. 
she's tenacious, my wonderful wife, but her hobby's brought great stacks of strife: she collects, she's fanatic. our basement and attic hold every back number of life. 
"clear the duckweed," they said, "it's a blight." no sweat, but it hardly seemed right: this emerald plant on dark ponds can enchant like green stars on a black, liquid night. 
her image possesses my mind, only hinted, not fully defined: in the moonglow, she's sweet, downy skin, rumpled sheet, gently barred by the light through the blind. 
her exposure in clubs took her far. j.d. slusher became candy barr. this gangster's-girl/stripper could wield a mean zipper. god's bounty made candy a star. 
vespasian's son, known as domitian, succeeded to quite a position. he rebuilt much of rome, and fought wars far from home. he was murdered ? an act of sedition. 
watch the best at the brickyard and learn how to corner ? perform a tight turn. they manage the curves, seldom skidding, no swerves, well deserving the winnings they earn. 
in indianapolis, racers at the brickyard are hounded by chasers. drivers jockey and surge; cars converge, re-emerge, flashing past with the fire of tracers. 
the bishop is under my skirt (not the priest but a pad you insert): like lillian russell i'm sporting a bustle. this device once made gentlemen flirt. 
of four elements all things are made, ancient discourses clearly conveyed. all the gods would require: earth, air, water and fire. how'd they do it? a trick of the trade. 
ships use battens to hold things in place: metal pieces screwed tight, just in case. if they're swamped by a wave, then these battens should save them from damage ? no loss, no disgrace. 
southern tip of new york after dark, a warm evening in battery park: the twin towers are missing, but young couples? still kissing ? lady liberty still makes her mark. 
they're a small, select group, the elite, but with chauncey they'd feel more complete. they beguile and they needle him, charm him and wheedle him: "join us, and the world's at your feet." 
almost-holes in the top of your shoe? good thing they don't really go through. those designs are not random: the shoemaker planned 'em. that's broguing ? an odd thing to do. 
you should order the coeur ? la cr?me? it's their cream cheese and sour cream gem. with fresh berries on top, it's the pride of the shop. fussy folks say, "too sweet," but that's them. 
she's aloft on his hands ? she's sixteen ? when her dad stumbles onto the scene. "you seemed calm," says her coach, with a glare of reproach, "when i said i was benching colleen." 
i'm a cut above perfect, it's true: something grand, a one-man pas de deux. sure, i'm beating my chest, 'cause i've topped all the rest. if you woke up as me, you would too. 
i did seventeen months in the pen? found the lord, found the exit, and then found a woman to guide me, found a new man inside me. life's coming up roses again. 
getting through to my wife's like a chase when her mind isn't there, just her face. well, damn her defiance; i'll blind her with science ? i'll spray her with logic, like mace. 
when i bowl, i expect satisfaction. skill and science ? it's not an abstraction: the ball curves toward the pins; my conclusion begins. extra movement pays off. it's called action. 
those with money or power? depraved! shed them all, and the masses are saved. bakunin's life theme: down with every regime. revolution must free the enslaved. 
by example and free conversation, so that logic defends inspiration, i shall buttress my creed, both in word and by deed: my apology, my affirmation. 
atargatis, of syrian lore, was part woman, part fish ? and what's more, some cultists, it's written, unsexed themselves, smitten by their goddess. no man could do more. 
last night, you were cuddly, delightful, but today, you've been arctic and frightful. with a stare cold as ice, gone to nasty from nice, you've turned distant. i'd swear you seem spiteful. 
eating entrails appears so debasing. perhaps, but this food's world-embracing: top chefs are well-versed in morcilla and wurst. they're sausages ? stuffing in casing. 
"tighten up, boy, it's got to be strong. wrong nuts, and those bolts are too long," he declares from his chair as i do the repair. armchair general: raucously wrong. 
theologian of note, johann eck, saw reforms, for a time, held in check. martin luther's chief foe, he sustained status quo ? to the protestants: pain in the neck. 
traits so feline in her keep recurring: she'll bask in the sun, barely stirring, glide about, like a cat, and a cute one at that. and when curled in my lap, she'll be purring. 
hard eight ? play the line ? easy four: at a craps table (not on the floor) a box man splits chips with his deft fingertips, collects or pays out when you score. 
dan's got orders: his juices are flowing, and he can't tell his wife where he's going. till he goes, she'll keep active, dress well, stay attractive, and busy herself with her sewing. 
there are uses for cinquefoil, the plant (uses quite comprehensive, i grant). keep some roots as contingency ? good for astringency. trust all those herbals? i can't. 
the resorts of spain's costa del sol have long been a popular goal. moor your yacht at a club; do a spa, get a rub, hit a beach. it'll help you feel whole. 
great films draw us in to a scene using motion and light on a screen. so a top art director is a "mood man," connector, master chef of pictoric cuisine. 
lynn gives bowling advice at the lanes: "you've been hitting one-two," she explains. jim answers, "now look, lynn, i aim for the brooklyn ? that pocket's my strike," he maintains. 
robert abplanalp, aerosol king ? with his valve, one can spread any thing: oil or paint in a spray (found a new use today) ? so for bob, the inventor, "ka-ching!" 
my toro mows short down below, sickles guiding the grass; watch it go: as the lawn gets a new cut from the bed-knife, a crewcut, i try not to feed it my toe. 
in some larger cathedrals, perhaps smaller chapels extend from the apse. many tasks to fulfill in pursuing god's will ? supplementaries fill in the gaps. 
our appliance garage is complete. now it's lined, so the wood takes the heat. with our toaster, our blender, it's a kitchen defender! maybe pointless, but very discreet.

she was foaled with such startling force that a howitzer seemed an apt source, so we thought of krupp's gun: western front, world war i, and we named her big bertha, of course. 
apollinaire may require some explaining: "it is raining my soul. it is raining, but it's raining dead eyes," the surreal poet cries. guillaume's deep ? but i think entertaining. 
"you don't get me," i said, "i won't run. go ahead ? call me names, have your fun. you can pout; you can brood ? i'm not bulldozed by crude. makes no difference to me; it's all one." 
how oddly preposterous ? droll that my ex has been dating a troll. she has wit, charm and style; he's vulgar and vile. i should laugh, but it's shredding my soul. 
a bullhook can pierce a beast's hide. it's a pole that's a pain in its side. yet trainers, those fools, use these inhumane tools just to break down an elephant's pride. 
an eccentric commander-in-chief was determined to turn a new leaf. he declared himself jain, worshiped forests and rain, and his home? a druidic motif. 
"why are barn doors on sets?" suzy asks. "that's what gaffers call variable masks. when their opening's slim, then the lighting is dim; when it's wide, well, an actor just basks." 
he played sony and sega all day: stealing cars, blowing humans away. had he just cracked a book, he might not be a crook with a jet and his own swiss chalet. 
though you're armored and trained for this fight, your opponent expects to find fright. so, remember, your grace, mask your mien with that face mask. 'neath your beaver, you're fierce. you're all knight. 
"you bug me," he said?so i did: placed a mike in his can, 'neath the lid, and one under his bed and the light overhead? tiny bugs all around?all well hid. 
though i majored in english and psych, i've loved planting since i was a tyke. that's what life's been about: reaching up, branching out ? i'm dendritic, and that's what i like. 
i asked dad for advice on investing. he was wary ? resisted suggesting. his caution still lingers: "just don't burn your fingers! if you're hurt, there'll be no use protesting." 
this emplacement once held a great gun. now it basks in the normandy sun. no more fears of invasions ? it serves peaceful occasions: couples use it for holiday fun. 
that dull-witted son-of-a-bitch can't find his way home, but he's rich! yeah, no great education, but the eyes of the nation are on him, 'cause that boy can pitch. 
it's a simple affirmative defense. i'll get off if they've got any sense. he was whipping my horse, so i killed him?of course. hire a lawyer? a needless expense. 
i reflect on the scholarship gained, all the primitive ways i've explained ? spent my life in the jungle (tried each new anti-fungal), 'cause i'm anthropologically trained. 
once his brewery opened its doors, there were profits for young adolph coors. with clear creek as a source and his know-how, perforce his name's golden, in taverns and stores. 
"roasted witch, poisoned food, butchered toes ? grimm's too grim for young minds; out it goes!" until bettelheim said that it's good for the head: both enchanted and chilled, a child grows. 
better groundwork and research were needed from all, then the business succeeded. "do our homework," we said. "we prepare or we're dead." now our prospects look great ? unimpeded. 
i should care how that idiot feels? no, it's time to just dig in my heels? ditch him, once and for all, nail his ass to the wall? no waffling, no pleas and no deals. 
the old man died in harness one night: at his desk, in the bright office light. i still pass by his door; he's not there any more? but my heart says, "ghost enters, stage right." 
"we need votes, man. those folks by the river seem behind us, but just by a sliver." "relax?we'll do fine. i can keep them in line." "you can talk, man, but can you deliver?" 
she wouldn't, of course, interfere, even whisper a word in his ear. so, subtly, in mime, using gestures of time, with a dumb show, she made herself clear. 
with his buddies, he's puckish, an elf, while his other's locked up, on a shelf. he dissociates freely; he's frightened. ideally, we'll put him in touch with himself. 
we're arrayed for our night on the town: edie's borrowed a mink and a gown. they'll be seeing our faces at all the right places? no stinting; we'll do it up brown. 
what we found has the family buzzin', like those programs burt stashed by the dozen and those crisp little skirts, and those shoes ? bet that hurts! that's my closet balletomane cousin. 
it's been years since i've been on a date. now i'm balding, slowed down, overweight. once i knew all the drills? i'll just dust off my skills: keep my cool. the rewards should be great. 
press these driver ant heads 'cross your cut; they'll clamp on ? now you're sure i'm a nut. pulled apart, now, dispatched, with their heads left attached, as with sutures, they'll keep your wound shut. 
on his horn, he was smooth as could be? clear and sweet, and we heard it for free. played us soldiers to sleep: "close your eyes; count your sheep." he was bugle boy, company b. 
boss, you've never come close to that place. i've been over it twice, just in case. so sit back and relax, 'cause i've covered your tracks: no papers or prints ? not a trace. 
almost there ? grab your kids and your pack (bus stays locked till it's time to head back). road dead-ends in the park, where we'll all disembark. perfect day ? get this picnic on track! 
a lissome professional dancer sues a grower for alar-linked cancer. the suit overreaches (never used on his peaches), but the orchardist's moved to romance her. 
 displacement, when full, often runs into hundreds of thousands of tons: thus we measure a tanker. at sea or at anchor, up close, its enormousness stuns. 
she's been added adjunctively ? still, she's far better than run-of-the-mill. bet she's smarter by half than the regular staff, and i love that she dresses to kill. 
hold this body ? this old, borrowed dust; share my shadow, my heart, if you must. you're a breeze through my mind. still, i leave you behind: i am failing, succumbing to rust. 
is this possible, doc? i'm so young to be suffering from cheese worker's lung. yet i'm wheezing, i cough, and my lung scan is off, showing mold spores that flew past my tongue. 
those reporters are waiting outside. we can't seem to have something to hide. if they're armed with the facts, we'll be stopped in our tracks. keep it simple: "your sources have lied." 
spa regulars come for the flow that emanates there, from below. one sees mothers and daughters indulge in those waters, kick back and just let the stress go. 
mom kept struggling to bring out the best in him, but she never could settle the pest in him. he'd go raging about then call, "mom, bail me out." now it's murder. there's one last arrest in him. 
it grows dark; there's a deafening din as the pall of a dust storm moves in: nature's surface-to-air stings your eyes, grits your hair. stand firm ? it'll sandblast your skin. 
from her brain issue tortured creations: wicked canvases, weird emanations. something's taken a toll on the well of a soul that keeps spewing these base desecrations. 
did those terrorists finally free you? i peer through those crowds to id you. should i party or pray or just savor this day? what a joy! it elates me to see you. 
she's impressed by her face; it's the dimple. she'd sue god at the very first pimple. when she checks her reflection, all she sees is perfection. that's an egotist's life, pure and simple. 
a heart's emblematic of love, while for peace, an old standby's the dove. we've no need to create a design that says "hate" ? the swastika fits like a glove. 
this defendant's accused of misprision, and deserves careful thought, not derision. brought together to do it, we're set to get to it? empaneled to make a decision. 
last night rolled along as i'd planned: perfect food, quiet talk ? kept it bland. a slow stroll by the lake (nothing heavy at stake) ? she was soon eating out of my hand. 
that was wrong, even though you were right: stupid comment ? we're in for a fight. call their editor pompous? he's boxing the compass. we'll lose his endorsement tonight. 
the disabled list reads a to z: torn achilles, the flu, twisted knee. when a sprain or condition strikes any position, a reliable bench is the key. 
where the promenade lines brooklyn heights, the east river reflects dazzling sights of manhattan beyond as my love and i bond amid strollers and floral delights. 
seven-ten, it's a bitch to convert. my last shot, or i'm losing my shirt. a peculiar finale: fall short on the alley ? make this spare, or it's sure gonna hurt. 
on the stage, we have business to learn: how to sit, where to look, when to turn. i must know who's behind me, and you, where to find me. actors' actions ? no minor concern. 
ten more months on this god-awful base? i'll be catching my death in this place, 'cause it's clammy and cold and i'm sleeping with mold ? hell, even the food's a disgrace. 
there are days when the wife loses touch: i'm original sin; she's too much. i cause wars and inflation ? it's rank defamation. if a butterfly dies, i'm in dutch. 
we bearded the lion at last ? at rehearsal, revealed a recast. it was time to confess that the lead was a mess ? cut our losses, replace him, and fast. 
read the sign, "anatomical wonders!" that's what carneys parade as god's blunders. one's a girl with a beard who's just gawked at and jeered; one's an "ogre," whose flatulence thunders. 
at each entrance, he must strike a pose; he declaims to the outermost rows. he's chewing the scenery and waltzing with greenery. how he keeps the part, nobody knows. 
there are critters out there in the hush ? baby beasties that blend in the brush: they don't dazzle like clowns, but wear dun, grayish browns (it could even prove deadly to blush). 
i'll be forced to dip into our savings. i'm bidding to win those engravings; i couldn't be surer: each one is a d?rer. "too much," you say? philistine ravings. 
the andosol's thick on my lands; it provides what a planter demands. my crops never spoil in volcanic-based soil. it's just dirt, but my dirt understands. 
think this bout will be easy ? just fun? i'll take anyone on, one-on-one. i'm a blue hen from delaware who'll soon leave you well aware: we rock, baby ? second to none. 
the board's published a plan with a list: comprehensive ? yes, no one's been missed. called our "we can pull through print," it's really their blueprint, with warnings ? their velvet-gloved fist. 
here's the book on this kid: he can bunt; stay alert, 'cause he's up for a stunt. look, we know the kid's smart ? baseball head, lots of heart ? if he squares, don't charge too close up front. 
half your life's about what you should wear, but you're perfect, so why should you care? why not borrow a page from those strippers onstage: wear whatever, then lay it all bare. 
a ceraunics professor was trained in how heat was conserved, used or drained. an electric device or the nature of ice was his field ? and his fervor? unfeigned. 
what's the fuss? just an old wedding ring. not much value?how much would it bring? i can face that you're gone; guess i'll just leave it on. it's my right. i've grown used to the thing. 
dumas wrote of three musketeers and d'artagnan (inseparable peers), of ardor and lust, of confidence, trust. dumas, p?re, has lived long past his years. 
indigestion, or is that its speech? first it rumbles, then builds to a screech. this alien's vowel sounds remind me of bowel sounds, and they issue, it seems, from its breech. 
you'll find that she's full of surprises, like her bra cups of opposite sizes. view her right boob for free; for the left, there's a fee. and a tandem display? the fee rises. 
communications have gone through transition. you're dismissed as a land line technician. don't just picket and pout; change directions, branch out. with new skills, you're a whole new edition. 
this faction, new-risen, emergent, must be ruthlessly managed. it's urgent! before they start growing, clean their nests out; get going. your code name: insurgent detergent. 
my estate's my escape; it's my base, where i hunt on my own private chase. i run deer and small game (unimpressed by my name). it's primordial, a raw change of pace. 
intellectuals surely took note of the essays that emerson wrote: truth's not doctrine-dependent, but simple, transcendent ? intuitive ? never remote. 
want to learn something? get off your ass! read some books or enroll in a class. it will someday hit home that all roads lead to rome. in the end, it will all come to pass. 
my aunt blabby just chatters away, telling tales of life "back in the day," adding facts here and there, details snatched from mid-air ? her "embellishments" ? lies, i would say. 
he can learn; he's got great versatility, backed by dignity, looks and virility. would they vote for him? no, 'cause he can't run the show. popularity's not electability. 
my new cessna's half in my garage, like some travel art photomontage. one small boy i heard shout, "that plane's butt's hangin' out." i called back, "that's my plane's empannage." 
as my wife sits applying her base, once again, i'm admiring her face. with that skin, she's my pride; she has nothing to hide. "not so much! that's my favorite place." 
i don't care if he founded the biz; the corporate funds are not his. for his personal pleasure, he raided our treasury. embezzlement! that's what this is. 
she's too sylphlike, too flawless of face, an embodiment: beauty and grace. though perhaps not intended, she's annoyingly splendid ? a polestar to all in the place. 
she was hired as his ace in the hole; she'd make changes, then he'd take control. his plan's never borne fruit. she's a cold, empty suit: sans savvy, sans vision, sans soul. 
dance-obsessed since one cruise-ship excursion, i've made tango a lifetime immersion. competitively dancing of late, i'm romancing the judges with hints of perversion. 
regions change, and biota keep pace. variations arise for each case. when the great glaciations brought successful mutations, emergent evolution took place. 
no excuses ? you're plastered, don't lie again. we're all sick of you saying you'll try again. if you fail to dry out, i'm beginning to doubt that we'll care enough even to cry again. 
an embarrassment of riches, i'd say: wear my clothes once, then toss them away. but i sing, i'm a star; the whole world's my bazaar, so i splurge every prodigal day. 
don't accuse me of eavesdropping, punk! but i did hear you pushing that junk. can't believe what you're doing; don't you know who you're screwing? you used my place? you must've been drunk. 
on the stage, he spoke rather emphatically, and postured and gestured dramatically. while appearing intense, he was making no sense. once again, he was thinking erratically. 
undiscloseable black operations serve the policy goals of most nations: surreptitiously planned, unofficially manned, in all kinds of obscure situations. 
the prince and bewitching brunette had a wedding we'll never forget: with caparisoned steeds at deliberate speeds, and circumstance solemnly set. 
as we struggle, our deadline draws near. it's become ineluctably clear: though alive and, yes, kicking, our clock is still ticking? hope a last-minute grant will appear. 
some camp followers, during past wars, were wives and stock-minders and whores, they might try to impress in a womanly dress, or go masculine down to their drawers. 
my eczema's awful today; these emollients don't work as they say. i've tried plenty of ointments ? all big disappointments. hot and itchy, i'm flaking away. 
lots of people would pay you for that. would you please keep it under your hat? if you don't breathe a word about what you've just heard, it's for certain they won't smell a rat. 
someone notify doug's next of kin, 'cause that puff adder's broken his skin, and we got here too late, so there's not long to wait: any moment, doug's sure to cash in. 
this nit-picker's power's too great. call the question, man; choke off debate. once we've gagged the old goat, we can call for a vote. shut him down, 'cause i've got a hot date. 
she's been bleeding me dry by the quart, for herself and our children's support. now i'm working part-time, and i've spent my last dime. looks like this month, i'm coming up short. 
a duplicitous lout on a date said, "let's go now, my goddess ? it's late." she read sex on his mind, cupped his chin and declined: "bed a goddess? you can't pay the freight." 
i'm chumming, provoking the fish with some fabulous fish-tempting dish. i'll use corn crushed in bread or some chopped salmon head; they'll be primed for the hook, as i wish. 
mine's a punishing, stressful profession. i must choose every word with discretion. though i'm serving my nation, i need a vacation to unwind, simmer down: decompression. 
his half-baked and vague delineation of programs to "heal our sick nation" helped win our affection. he won the election, and we wait, in widespread aggravation. 
you're the honcho for now, but you'll see, my support all these years won't come free. once i've turned things around, put your face in the ground, you'll be dancing attendance on me. 
"it's mineral-clogged," he opined. "your water's left blockage behind." it's basic home science: maintain each appliance. decalcify. keep it in mind. 
this game's boring? leave that up to me. i'll reveal what the cameras don't see, like the home lives of players, and sport's hidden layers. i do color (and sharp repartee). 
out carousing one night at cornell, he was crossing the gorge, and he fell. the school's chasmed and canyoned; he was baked, uncompanioned. alone, he had no hope in hell. 
we will always, somehow, have enough. thanks to science, we've plenty of stuff: cornucopian views can inhibit the blues. if they're wrong, though, the future looks rough. 
since he looted that mutual fund, he's been justly berated and shunned. dare he try exhumation of his dead reputation? if he carries it off, i'll be stunned. 
a new restaurant's opened uptown with a chef they claim cooked for the crown. the appointments are charming, but the food tastes alarming. to be trendy, i'm choking it down. 
buy and sell: that's my longtime profession. i screwed up on a recent accession: bought a heavy sealed box that said "old prity rocks," not "guns." they've charged criminal possession. 
when an animal bristles with fear, an arrector pili's purpose is clear: these minuscule muscles raise its hairs, then it hustles to hide and (it hopes) disappear. 
well, huzzah for the captive bolt gun. food on hoof it's intended to stun. then a slaughterer cuts it and drains it and guts it. pig out ? don't let me spoil your fun. 
using bulbs in the kitchen's in favor; either onion or garlic adds flavor. but don't crush it, just bruise it ? that's the best way to use it. take a crack; get the knack ? it's a saver. 
give advice, but with less elaboration. you distract with too much information. how to get to the moma? start from here, not tacoma ? name the train, but not every damn station. 
while she's hosting, she seems thrilled to bits. morning after, she's more like the blitz: always biliously sniping, and grousing and griping. post-party post-mortems: the pits. 
while we bury our heads in the sand, the ungoverned have had a free hand: lawless cutthroats and thugs, out for kicks, high on drugs, anarchically ravage our land. 
as she lolled, nothing left undisclosed, students sketched; she fought yawns, nearly dozed. she reclined, on display, arranged any which way: immobile, yet alterably posed. 
despite research and groundwork and ink, this new auto goes down in a wink. like some four-wheeled sore thumb, edsel's time hasn't come. ford's titanic: back off; watch it sink. 
she'll appear and make hearts skip a beat, with ensembles well-chosen and neat. if it rains unremittingly, she dresses befittingly: in spandex that spans head to feet. 
we're not sure any more this is cool. this graffiti's the work of a fool. we're finally effacing it, scrubbing, erasing it, restoring the walls of the school. 
"an electroencephalograph on a scaffold? you're making me laugh. you're just charting a brain: lie him down; be humane." "but our subject's an active giraffe." 
she tried out for the circus, and blew it, but with sheep, she knows just how to do it: watches over our stock, cuts one out of the flock. where's her contract? i want to renew it. 
getting published by them will be tricky: they're quite editorially picky. maybe you'll get their nod, but their attitude's odd. they still boast of rejecting james dickey. 
sabers drawn, flashing steel, row on row, in the wars not all that long ago: they'd engage, they'd connect, with horrendous effect. edged weapons would slice through a foe. 
solid logic is lasting, enduring, based on evidence ? safe, reassuring. to think more constructively, reason deductively, though diversion's seductive, alluring. 
sailing out from our warm coral keys toward the sun, we had following seas? made good easting all day, splitting waves, throwing spray, pushed along by a westerly breeze. 
had she acted disreputably? yes: foul language, indecorous dress. there'd be no turning back, so we gave her the sack. now she's suing; good lord, what a mess! 
when he begged to, just once, share her bed: "in your dreams, pig. i'd rather be dead!" still, his hope springs eternally: he pursues her ? infernally, determinedly stumbling ahead. 
descendibility's prime in a slope; if it's rugged, for me there's no hope. my ideal, i'm afraid, is a nice, gentle grade. while this ski resort's hot, i'm no dope. 
he's a crackerjack salesman, you bet, and as cool as a mozart quartet. he's determined which stars love collectible cars, and who must own a vintage corvette. 
"sure, i haunt every soho boutique; i go clubbing: one has to be chic. but i dine economically," she said, grinning comically, "by eating just four times a week." 
our amalgam is fresh to this scene. it's a blend: asian fusion cuisine, mixing javanese/thai/ cantonese?worth a try? food symphonic, so good it's obscene. 
danielle and i dated dutch treat. she'd get greens and i'd stoke up on meat. gourmet or buffet, we'd each pay our own way. oh so civil, but so incomplete. 
time to pay. think our service comes cheap? here's your statement ? now read it and weep. think it's steep? it's not fair? well, guess what ? i don't care. cough it up, man, you're into us deep. 
i've been visited nightly by fears: twisted versions of life's souvenirs. i've had feverish schemes: find a cleanser for dreams that would purge stressful thoughts and dry tears. 
such outrageous effrontery's crass. it presumes one's entitled ? takes brass. when due, we show deference, but meritless preference? no! we conduct things with class. 
an efficiency just will not do; there are three of us, not one or two. i'd be losing my space with your mom in my face. this apartment's one bedroom too few. 
there the challenger sits, on his stool, with his thoughts on the bout, looking cool. but this fight will be vital: his shot at the title. he'll be ruthless and hard, even cruel. 
once bombed, now the ginza's all light, as it glows with industrial might. tokyo now, former edo (it rhymes well with meadow): by night, it's a dazzling sight. 
dutch guiana was suriname's past. now it hosts a remarkable cast: lots of hindus, chinese, some maroons, if you please, and the upshot: the food is a blast! 
i put thousands on eephboy today, but he's back in the pack ? that's okay. in the tight final turn he shows power to burn: he's sliced through; now he's breaking away. 
i've told everyone, "this one's for me ? competition's stayed home; don't you see?" at the end of the race, i've got egg on my face. i've embarrassed myself, so feel free. 
loads of room in the rear to lade freight, and i'm licensed to serve every state. i can clear a quick buck on the bed of my truck, but your cargo, sir, that's tempting fate. 
eat your words, or i'll make them your last. take them back, 'cause you're badly outclassed. clear my rep with my crew or i'll break you in two. what the hell do you know of my past? 
eat your hearts out, you fools! this one's mine. just one look, then i must draw the line. i'm a reprobate sinner, but, then, i can slide in her: my bugatti. back off there, you swine! 
"we'll use colors direct from the sky. they'll go easy," she said, "on the eye." on our first anniversary, we're bedecking a nursery. there's no need, i suspect, to say why. 
my buddy, once bland and unbedded, wears rasta-style gear, his hair dreaded. i'd urged him to take a nice trip to jamaica ? he found love and jerk chicken and wedded. 
by the warm aitutaki lagoon, overseen by a dazzling moon, the breeze in the palms both caresses and calms. i'll return, polynesia ? and soon. 
for me, there's just no higher high than a dish of sweet black bottom pie. this treat cuts the mustard with two kinds of custard. the concept alone makes me sigh. 
so you're chilled by our central ac? we can regulate flow, if need be, with the moveable plate in a damper. but wait. there's a fee, sir, 'cause nothing comes free. 
"this will clear up your skin," read the ad (all the itching was driving her mad). the stuff stank?it was rank, but her rash quickly shrank, and she never found out what she had. 
books on nature need never be boring when it's fun to get out there, exploring. if our world's described lyrically, we'll confirm it empirically, our delight in creation sent soaring. 
since they faxed her this cold, pointed letter, it's posted. we'll never forget her: "you've been missing work chronically; you're replaced electronically. a machine won't play sick?and works better." 
electrocution's a hard possibility when you work for a power utility. when some circuit shorts out, don't go feeling about. you'll fry with alarming facility. 
though in bars, we may banter and fleer, i'm concerned by their convenance here. such language! extremely ill-chosen, unseemly where delicate ears may come near. 
i want access the boss won't allow to a file that's a real "sacred cow." got my shot; i won't blow it. i learn fast and i'll show it: commit it to memory?now! 
when he speaks, he makes furniture care; he awakens with drama and flare. it's an aura he weaves: we believe he believes. he electrifies everyone there. 
i fell for this car on the spot. should've bargained, of course; i could not. she's so vivid and bright, bet she glows in the night. my electric blue mustang is hot. 
i've turned ashen, as white as a sheet, and i'm squirming about in my seat. thoughts of snakes on a plane are at loose in my brain, and the cargo bay's under my feet. 
"my new boyfriend," she said, "imports dope. c'mon, pops, put away that old rope. it's some chemical goo with a function or two? you don't think i'm that stupid, i hope." 
i don't read ? never got no degree. collect freebies ? they're my cup of tea. so i love books of matches. then one lights; it all catches! did i close before striking? screw me! 
what's your problem? you'd better take stock. so she's pretty. so what? you're a jock. girls are pleased if you're gentle; instead, you go mental. don't "can't" me ? just drive through your block. 
he's got ceaseless cerebral capacity, and reads with tremendous voracity. this strange hunger, this need ? on what stuff does it feed? it's like time, this enduring edacity. 
all these petty-ass, chicken inspections, and he flips at the least imperfections. his commandery's seething; i'm amazed he's still breathing. such outrages spark insurrections. 
"we've been fishing; our engine just died. it's damn hot and we're dry and we're fried." "you need beers; stop your rowing. we'll rig you for towing. boat your oars, boys, and slide alongside." 
in cuzco, that andean treasure, we explored narrow streets at our leisure. then we loved machu picchu, high ruins that reach you: the spell of the incas ? a pleasure. 
we met on the rue madeleine. we loved briefly, intensely, and then sadly drifted apart. now i look to my heart, my eyes clouding all over again. 
i write congress (like they ever care), try an anchorman (nobody's there). i tote signs day and night. people won't see the light: satan reigns. hell, i'm beating the air. 
there are markets left open to fill. if we fail to expand, others will. (i'll admit that i'm hopin' for my post they'll open a branch office down in brazil.) 
you approach her and then you fall back. that's a dubious plan of attack. if you're doubting yourself, you'll remain on the shelf. step aside. let a pro have a crack. 
something new's on o'malley's buffet labeled "boxty" ? i tried some today. it was mashed and fried spuds which i ate with iced buds. is that irish? well, maybe halfway. 
sip some barack, hungarian brandy, from apricots ? sweeter than candy. your guests, well, a lot'll look twice at the bottle, and think it's obama's; that's dandy. 
elasmobranchs (sharks, skates and rays) get a lot of attention these days. "let's go dive with a shark, for the sport, for a lark." crazy thrill-seeking, great white buffets. 
emancipation's release from one's ties; for a slave, it's the ultimate prize. it also invokes minors' breaks with their folks or when prejudice opens its eyes. 
my drive home's gonna drive me insane with those chuckholes and ruts ? inhumane. though my back's not that strong, i keep bumping along. i've tried letters and calls ? all in vain. 
maps show ethnic or vote distribution, or range or effects of pollution. i use choropleth maps in polemics, as traps created with deft execution. 
when a specimen joins our collection, we start with an ectal inspection: kept whole and unbloodied, it's externally studied, then out come the knives for dissection. 
her new song began life as a flop, but her agent's the cream of the crop. though it's been quite a pull, it hit third (with a bullet) ? that sign says she'll soon be on top. 
as activity comes to a stop at our dojo, one hears the dust drop. teacher inks the carved stone in bright red. "be it known: you are master ? i seal with this chop." 
in light of the pounds i'd been shedding, i produced my old tux for the wedding. it was bindingly tight so i gave up the fight, bought a new tux. my gut's resumed spreading. 
so he canned you, so screw him! so?shoot, we'll take amtrak: one long, last commute. and i'll manage your pain in our room on the train. i'll make nice to you, darlin', en route. 
her delta wing cuts through the skies; speed is safe with the lift it supplies. she can put on a show, then set down nice and slow: the f-106 dart, what a prize! 
again, ham and cheese? how clich?d, ah, but egg-dipped and butter-saut?ed: "today's sandwich du jour, fresh from france, croque monsieur"? sounds just different enough, and "home-made." 
when you're planning new roads, it behooves you ? make lefts less precarious moves. by the use of diverging diamonds, the merging of traffic and turning improves. 
that banderol over our door bears our motto, "go forth and explore." it's carved fully unscrolled, yet that's all it can hold. it was chiseled before the great war.

"surf's up!" need i say any more? we all jam in the jeep for the shore. if we're crowded and  cramped, we don't notice, we're amped? energetic and hyped to the core. 
some anchors hold buildings together. with tie rods, they counter rough weather. they're the clamps that stem swellings in the walls of some dwellings. walls can bulge; anchors work like a tether. 
daily business in capital city is legal but not very pretty. congress writes its own rules (and we let them; we're fools), then appropriates stuff in committee. 
this old poster's been gnawed at by mice. mark it down, if you want my advice. think your clients are suckers? it's got buckles and puckers from damp. that's a ludicrous price. 
botanicals animate places, on walls and all manner of spaces. our family dines midst these floral designs. some are framed and some decorate vases. 
we built strong, but the weather seeped through. we learned cladding's the best thing to do. must have been the right call, 'cause our new outer wall keeps us dryer. it looks better, too.

profound conflicts in novels seem real. they've a near-universal appeal. we're distracted by actions; ideas are abstractions, but those moral dilemmas we feel. 
why pursue the ideal illustration? use corbis, avoid litigation. they've bought digital rights to some millions of sights? one more lucrative bill gates creation. 
that's a colt double-action, my son. it's a six-cartridge cylinder gun. once your rounds are pushed in, give its chambers a spin. this revolver's for business, not fun. 
i expect your respect for our guest; don't play cute?i will not be impressed. too clever's annoying, too sweet even cloying. "be yourself" isn't always the best. 
emblazonry's tough, but i'm trying: our shield's colors demand reapplying. but the detail's too much on my forebears' escutcheon, and the hues so intense, i've been crying.

she was raised in an ivory tower, but now rules in the corridors of power, where her every decision shows prudence and vision. her influence grows by the hour.

where my arm peters out, there are creases, or you might say, they're where my hand ceases. called bracelets, not bangles, they're smooth, without angles, like a gasket ? a juncture of pieces. 
cooling quickly, it's cook-time in camp by the lake in the light of one lamp. time to grill the tomatoes and whip some potatoes with scallions and butter ? that's champ.

we were landlocked and dry as could be. we decided to issue this plea: "you're our last, best resort; we need use of your port and a corridor through to the sea." 
our lifestyle, to some, is exotic 'cause we're openly homoerotic. sure we're "sapphic," that's chill, even "butch," if you will. but "dykey"? what are you, psychotic? 
"wait, you drank a whole bottle of scotch?" "not the bottle, the booze, dad ? top notch (never tried drinking glass). that glenlivet ? first class. 'bout to start your ardbeg; wanna watch?"

there are models next door, a whole slew, shooting glamour. i look?wouldn't you? they're all pouty and still, some propped up on the sill. my rooftop commands a great view. 
i don't say our decor should be cold, but these reds? a bit harsh, even bold. for our colors i'd choose forest greens and cool blues. cool is soothing, or so i've been told. 
colonel chovoff toured sundry locations, from parade sites to small celebrations. and he once gave a speech minus shirt at a beach, with his chest pierced by odd decorations. 
any tree wears its leaves in its crown. for an herb, the crown's much farther down: where its stems meet its roots, whence it sends up new shoots ? two botanical meanings, one noun.

tricked and trapped, so we take up a stand. we've been drygulched: cochise and his band. under fire and boxed in, lord above, save our skin ? this just ain't what the captain had planned.

once my lawn was distinctly first class, a well-manicured carpet of grass. but the river, in flood, left its refuse and mud. now my carpet's a putrid morass. 
i wore cargos wherever i went: perfect pockets worth every last cent. as i danced, they "exploded," disgorged and unloaded. my wedding became an event.

slow and parlous to sail all around, the long headland's all low-lying ground. we'll canal through the cape, then, in far better shape, boost our commerce in one giant bound. 
in australia, a camp is for sheep, or for cattle, whichever you keep. and they won't ask for tents or want nightly events, but a head count might put you to sleep.

childhood dreams: you're the next rising star. you matured, came to see who you are. a black robe's what you saw, so you studied the law, and today you've been called to the bar. 
chicharrones are pigskins, deep-fried; their addictiveness can't be denied: if you crunch some at lunch, bet you'll crave quite a bunch, but your heart would say, "push 'em aside."

in a nest to which mom's unattached, a brood parasite's own egg is hatched. there it's raised by another egg's dutiful mother after sometimes her own are dispatched.

from his youth in boulogne, he displayed love for study, then joined the crusade. when baldwin the first bought christ's foreskin, his thirst for a relic was slaked ? or betrayed.

"it's accursed!" he cries, quite histrionic. "i abjure art that's not aniconic. human forms in the arts? thus idolatry starts." his demeanor decays to demonic.

in an orchestra two (sometimes three) clarinetists are needed, like me. i'm elated, i swear, to be named second chair. to be first, though ? how great that would be.

when i said, "for my laundry: damp-dried," she looked up, mumbled, "nut-case," but tried. then, "damp-dry!" she rejoiced? "on the dry side of moist.
what's the next 'little test' for your bride?"

chappaquiddick: that infamous place, where ted kennedy failed in disgrace, left a woman to drown and then swam back to town? didn't bother reporting the case.

they released him to me; he's my son, but he's skipped. now the jerk's on the run. fifteen hours at large, but still he's my charge. i'm responsible; what have i done? 
i just wish the whole world understood: biological diversity's good. folks from spain to siberia would destroy all bacteria. but if germs could eat cancers, they should.

draped in flags, tightly packed, in the zone, as a unit, they'll get up or groan. the olympics are here: for their nations they cheer, chauvinistically backing their own. 
in spite of her tight reputation, the old broad makes a lavish donation. she's the big-hearted kind, once she's made up her mind. just relax; it's a slow operation. 
even gofers, we felt, should be smart, every aide kept informed from the start. as we shared the same goals, there were no minor roles, and each bit player played a real part. 
so that one's her bridegroom-elect? i suppose it's too late to object. he's in line to be kin, though that's not quite locked in. is he rich? with that face, i suspect.

the first interview's mine ? what a coup! i'm not shocked; it was long overdue. it's not just the commission ? i've arrived. recognition is mine, if i just follow through.

just at moonrise we pause, in suspension, as the glow on the snow eases tension: "may i ask your indulgence? the moon's cool effulgence beguiles me; it's worthy of mention." 
that huge breaker is topped by a comb, spilling forward in curtains of foam. the waves ceaselessly break and leave change in their wake. the shore's lovely? but not for my home. 
i just drank, couldn't stop, stole to pay, till her strength chased my demons away. sure she nags?she's a wife? she's my "trouble and strife," and she's why i can stand here today. 
as i tipsily grope for my drink, i'm off-balance, opponents may think. i employ drunken fist: martial art with a twist that i've trained in for years? i still stink. 
it's our lifeblood, this old mom-and-pop, but that burglary? over-the-top. nothing's left to restart, 'cause they tore us apart: overnight someone cleaned out our shop.

he writes eclogues, verse set in the leas,  in which shepherds converse at their ease. unworldly? perforce, and bucolic, of course; read his eclogues. start checking for fleas. 
at the mountains, they jettisoned loot; that great chain blocked the emigrants' route. wagons groaned with the weight; they'd packed far too much freight. now the passes were snow-bound, to boot. 
we showed up at my buddy's new flat? twice the size of my welcoming mat. i'd just managed to park us, then dropped my great carcass on something. i owe him a cat.

our new program's not catch-as-catch-can, but a carefully calibrated plan: it's both lifestyle and diet, fully tested?just try it. we'll transform you; you'll be a new man. 
'twas a difficult case for the doc at a cabstand in slippery rock: "what's this wheeling and dealing? it's quite unappealing." "it's our dickering hackery, doc."

the old engine careened down the track, sooty smoke streaking out of its stack, ever reeling and juddering, passengers shuddering in carriages jouncing in back. 
they've assigned me to "office esprit"; i do gossip?confirmed designee. it's my job just to schmooze, then to circulate news. and for this, i'm collecting a fee? 
ipanema's the home of the thong; pack a couple, you'll want to belong. leave behind all convention? you'll adore the attention. correct me, my dear, if i'm wrong. 
santa, mom needs a coat and a toaster. for me, santa, please send a coaster. on my sled i'd let go, swiftly slide through the snow? but do mom first: our top turkey roaster. 
we cleaned up, but i guess not enough, 'cause the wife just blew in, in a huff. when she's red like that, fuming, her storm clouds are looming. boys, brace yourselves; this could get rough. 
"easy does it," she says. "take it slow, or you'll hurt yourselves. trust me, i know." "listen, lady, you're sweet? settle down, rest your feet. we've moved steinways before. watch the show!" 
each year we indifferently gather for dull food, exhibitions and blather. my future intention's to skip these conventions. why not read the synopsis? i'd rather. 
continuity's what i'm about, so i reconcile "cut!" with start out: actors' hair, time of day, every prop on display. mine's a film job with rank but no clout. 
educationalists pick at our schools, test new theories and play with new "tools." their results are foregone: programs fail; they move on. and new experts get hired, with new rules. 
bottom line: mom resembled a manatee, so my truths were a gall to her vanity. i've been scrubbed from her will? that's a hard, bitter pill! as contestant, i challenge her sanity. 
says our town's anti-nuke pamphleteer: "any time, now, disaster is near: the reactor protection's been failing inspections; the containment's degrading, i fear." 
we routinely crop certain dogs' ears; it's a practice engaged in for years. cut short's better in fights (there's no dog bill of rights), and accepted by most of their peers. 
we sell dry goods, ma'am; please take our card, and our specialty's cloth by the yard. you'd buy calicos? tweeds? we stock everyone's needs, all supplied with our greatest regard. 
i enjoy looking back, reminiscing: puppy love seemed enough, nothing missing. now my life's in full swing, and i love the real thing, but i still get a charge out of kissing. 
with my barber, i have a routine: "cut it close, extra short, no machine." and we chatter?our theme is our favorite team, as i page through a men's magazine. 
before running, i stopped for a drink; there was crap in the trap of my sink. so i canceled my jog while i dealt with the clog: putrefaction?one hell of a stink. 
his command of the court's not in doubt; it's a clinic each time he goes out. you will never forget his great play at the net. he's what tennis today is about. 
first the highway climbed steeply for miles, then the fog killed the last of our smiles. but at last, the descent, an unnerving event: the bus shimmied; we hurled in the aisles. 
there's a climate of change around here. with the clubbiness lost, nothing's clear. there's an aura of doubt; those who can will bail out. as for me, i'll hang tough, persevere. 
touching hands, there we'd walk after school? bowered paths, unattended and cool. in that dark, leafy setting, we learned about petting. things seemed safer those days?as a rule. 
when i clerked at the high court last week, i was awed by its ancient mystique. then, impressed with myself, i slipped files from a shelf. call a plumber; the court's sprung a leak! 
fine art paper, coated and bright ? try our glossies or mattes; choose what's right. presentations with style? better grades are worthwhile, and our cottons cause love at first sight. 
god's elect should be pretty darn sure that their souls are untainted and pure, that their predestination means certain salvation. who's elect? god's released no brochure. 
think you'll pass me? you're out of your mind. just accept that i've won; be resigned. you're a loser, a bust. you've been eating my dust all along ? man, you're so far behind. 
the junior appointment at state is a yalie, about twenty-eight. i've been doing some reasoning: she's new, and needs seasoning. i'll just have to keep her up late. 
i don't care which politicos quote it; it's bogus, we'd never promote it. though you try to assure us the source is obscure? it's still copied. you can't claim you wrote it. 
he loses his head when she's late? fifteen minutes, the man's in a state. his interest's parental and pure, elemental: "i've a right to be angry?i rate." 
a great galleon, yet light on his feet, the old burgher sailed in off the street. for his aldermanly girth, patrons left a broad berth, where he anchored his favorite seat. 
your coin's circulated, see? it shows wear: there are edge nicks and scratches right there. and the mint mark's unclear? hurts the value, i fear. fetch top dollar? you haven't a prayer. 
what a strange new device his flag bore, fresh-embroidered, not seen there before: a blood-red ball and chain. the allusion was plain: "this one's taken." they all knew the score. 
you trade silks? a great journey awaits. use our entrepot out by the straits. there's no tariff, no tax; you can trust us. relax. we'll transship at competitive rates. 
it's commensurately scant compensation for the scant time you spend at your station. why so shocked and dismayed? you produce, then you're paid. you want more? what's your justification? 
our endowment's alumni-sustained: while they're here, they're administratively trained, then they head out and run things, from prisons to fun things. our coffers are bolstered, not drained. 
where my walk meets my lawn, it's precise, 'cause my edger's a clever device. it cuts a sharp border; my yard's in good order. trimming three times a week should suffice. 
"hey, that ostrich-bird's mangled my butt! take a look; i'm not some kind of nut." "not at all ? it would seem you were kicked by an emu. lie still, while i sew the gash shut." 
as two tablets dissolve, effervesce, their loud fizzing just adds to my stress. one day i'm in clover; the next, i'm hungover. bubbles burst: time to pause, reassess. 
she was lovely ? all dimples and curves; i was shy ? had to settle my nerves. then, one day, she strolled by, caught some other guy's eye. guess tomorrow, i'll join the reserves. 
expertise at his craft became clear as our carpenter capped his career, using exquisite grain (always hard to obtain) and selections of choice crotch veneer. 
when each overture fizzled and died, i felt snubbed, and just withered inside. i'm embittered, gone cold? my next act must be bold. may my targets find nowhere to hide. 
my computer's shut down: one more crash, so i'm chucking the damned piece of trash. gonna build it a pyre, melt it down in the fire? i'll dispose of the pain in the ash. 
we were cut from the same cloth, they say. we're alike, but precisely? no way. in matters of taste, i'm the diamond; she's paste: she loves pasta, and pasta's pass?. 
he's an oddity here at the beach, who the grommets refer to as "teach." every sentence is sick; man, this hodad is slick, and anomalously proper in speech. 
she hasn't the brains of a gnat. she's horse-faced, ungainly and flat. but she sprints like a cheetah; no one here's gonna beat her, and i'd bet my bottom dollar on that. 
what's been scripted the guy keeps revising at his desk; that's not new or surprising. but while reading the news, he's been airing his views. and that's pure editorializing. 
sure she knows how to dress, but the catch is her whole wardrobe's presorted, in batches, so it's easy to choose what to wear; she can't lose. they're coordinates: everything matches. 
let me cradle my son once again; let me hold him and rock him, and then take him home, if you must. unto dust i entrust his remains, just a month short of ten. 
hey, boss, there's no question i'm ready: all these years, i've put in for you ? steady. same old same old? you'll lose me; promote, don't just use me. going nowhere, i'm trapped in an eddy. 
she buys wholesale, at huge cash-and-carries: case of that, sacks of this?never varies. and her dating's the same: bulk's the name of her game. polyandry's for her? if she marries. 
my new aerie's delightful, it's true, with its dawn-greeting easterly view. as a day gathers steam, i look out at a dream: golden sunbeams and glistening dew. 
mark twain used precision and care to choose phrasing that sparkled with flair. now his works are enjoyed for the language employed ? words are tools, and such craftsmen are rare. 
when the rains came, we sloshed and canoed. then our sewers backed up ? we were screwed: feces flowed in the streets; sludge and muck messed our sheets. our sweet brook turned from babbling to rude. 
with a project to get off the ground, we'd been batting suggestions around: that should work, but this couldn't. though she'll join us, he wouldn't. in the end, only roadblocks were found. 
he's incomprehensibly deep, and it threatens to put us to sleep. clear your throat, maybe ? cough. if you don't choke him off, he'll keep droning. he's conjuring sheep. 
it's been windy; the lake water's rough. i feel sick. this one's gonna be tough. i've been rowing nonstop, but i can't fight the chop. about now, any landing's enough. 
"lost your claim check? good luck with your coat," said the girl, with a devilish note. "that just isn't cricket! it's gone, the damned ticket." "so's your coat, sir?i'll try not to gloat." 
the dried cockatoo tongues were in stock, but no sea turtle lungs or canned croc! gourmet catalogs fill us with stuff that could kill us, then bill us. right now we're in hock. 
look at you, you're all bubbly and cheery, when you're usually lifeless and weary. so ebullient today ? effervescent, but, hey, as a rule, you're insipid and dreary. 
sure you've no chance to win? then break clean. (you left schoolyards behind at fifteen.) instead, you throw mud till, i swear, you draw blood, and create an avoidable scene. 
he kept twitching and jerking his head; charlie's sanity hung by a thread. but he's finally calmed, he's been boxed and embalmed ? crossed the ultimate pond. now he's dead. 
dental fricatives: english has two, so from birth, we learn just what to do. whether ether or either, we've problems with neither; if you're foreign, that's not likely true. 
when a dry, bitter cold smote our ship, giving substance to "stiff upper lip," we set sail against time. neither snowstorm nor rime, a black frost had our souls in its grip. 
in hockey, to score is elusive, but one evening, some fans got abusive. i focused my rage and slapped two in the cage: shut 'em up?my two goals proved conclusive. 
the buses are painfully slow; we'll find taxis wherever we go; we could walk through the park, but it's lonely and dark, so we're cabbing tonight to the show. 
i'm a dog groomer thrown for a loss: he's the wiriest i've come across, with his long, tangled hair thick as cables, i swear. he appears to be furred in black moss. 
all that wisdom, your honor, and schooling, yet one look at my daughter ? you're drooling. was i wrong to confine her? men deny she's a minor. i'm begging the bench for a ruling. 
i colored when i was a kid; nothing calmed me as coloring did. porky pig? prussian blue. bugs in purple? can do. would i choose that today? god forbid. 
i dig legos; i've loved them for years. i told oprah ? bad choice, it appears: by the case, by the bin, they just keep pouring in. i've got blocks coming out of my ears. 
she craves contact. from years in confinement, she's now desperate for clinging entwinement. she clings far too tightly, and aches from it nightly: her spine needs a lumbar alignment. 
i'm confused, as i'm sure you can guess. i can't sleep for the worry and stress, since i lost our first folio and caused an embroglio? a troublesome, turbulent mess! 
"adeste," we summon in song, "fideles": no doubters belong. this caroling call is familiar to all. oh come, now ? don't tell me i'm wrong. 
at a cheese tasting held in killarney, our new cheddar's aroma seemed barny: reminiscent of hay. wasn't much we could say, so we blathered irrelevant blarney. 
why the hell should i answer to you? you're a suck-up; this day's overdue. sure, you're slick, but i'm tough; it's about to turn rough, so stand clear, 'cause i'm coming on through. 
they've arrived, the advance guard of sin, and, like roaches, they're settling in. easy call: clear them out; don't be hamstrung by doubt. once they're bounced, we can handle the spin. 
some bakers like bread to have shine: dull loaves just won't sell, they opine. so they're brushed, before baking, with an egg wash, thus making a gloss, so some health-nuts decline. 
an echelon's step-like formation overlaps to reject penetration. troops hold rank, row on row: a dispiriting show. it's a marvelous martial creation. 
i buy birds in the colors of booze; combinations affect how i choose. my latest's a parrot: chartreuse and deep claret? grand drinks and such contrasting hues. 
brother dom takes hot meals to the poor; tender daisy's half-dressed at the door. she claps eyes on this hunk and forgets he's a monk. now, alas, the hot meal's on the floor. 
after this bout, don't call me "obscure," 'cause as victor, my name will endure. touts declared, "you can't take him." i promised i'd break him. now my claim to the title's secure. 
the uncommon ones rise to our needs? humble heroes effecting great deeds. this plaque's for the one who rescued my son: "citation for valor," it reads. 
the crowd moaned, as the loathsome one led, then stood tall as their greek pulled ahead. with their spirit restored, that vast stadium roared. round the circus the chariots sped. 
they're beauties, my mom and old man, so i'll visit as long as i can: i'll just camp in the den, tell them, "guys, just say when." that's the good old american plan. 
my wife's lovely and lively: a catch, and it seems we're a pretty close match. but i've just met her sister (kind of sorry i'd missed her), who might be the pick of the batch. 
i love road trips, and i'm a survivor. i believe i'm a true defensive driver. i stay present, keep cool, heed the "two-second rule," and when tired, i'm a stop-and-take-fiver. 
best advice? i'd stay out of her way. she debuts tonight: boston ballet. let her weep, rant and vent; it's forbearance well spent. she's consumed with excitement today. 
her enticements i couldn't resist. ensorceled the moment we kissed, enslaved by her beauty? to her, i'm but booty: a conquest to add to her list. 
here's smooth layer on layer of shale, then it's bumpy, restarts?there's the tale: it's a discontinuity. this rock incongruity provides data too sound to assail. 
concealed weaponry's tough to detect; every part of your person is checked: we've found spring-loaded guns and explosive-clad buns, so we probe and explore and inspect. 
the play's leads flubbed their lines, had a fight. then the ingenue froze out of fright (we'd all known they'd miscast her). one more broadway disaster: we closed after opening night. 
"what the hell's economic geology?" "i suppose the reverse of ecology." "first exploring the earth, right? then exploiting our birthright." "quite so, and with modern technology." 
this communion you've had with the dead seems convincing. it fills me with dread. what the hell have you started? don't schmooze the departed! i'm afraid you're in over your head. 
in my novels, the plot serves a vision; at its crux comes a crucial decision. once all conflicts are clear, the climax draws near: it's a stressful internal collision. 
dead hungry one hot afternoon, we pull into the first greasy spoon. before long, my gut's turning, flip-flopping and churning. "let's locate a rest stop?and soon!" 
if there's trouble, he's causing his share, but you can't get him out of your hair. at the company feast, where you need him the least: a bad penny will surely be there. 
it's usually lengthy indeed and complex?one may need a re-read. it's a way to connect to the soul of a sect: a confession of faith is a creed. 
bougainville, mussau, rabaul: all were targets, the big and the small. reduce them, then break them, by all means retake them? the bismarcks, or sydney will fall. 
"listen, sparks, we've got enemy near; what you send's not for anyone's ear. which is why," he exploded, "all signals are coded!" turns out one was broadcast in clear. 
rotten raw scores that came as no shock: she should certainly flunk the whole flock, 'cause that's what we deserve. but she grades on a curve, and compared to the morons, i rock. 
lost composure and just blew your stack? then regain it; don't give him the sack. settle up, and with style: let him sweat for a while. first collect yourself, then get him back. 
central asia's the place of my birth. its farms tell you much of its worth, with rich chernozem soil, as dark as crude oil ? it's the region, they say, of black earth. 
for the potter, a long rope of clay is basic, not simply for play. she builds this coil up, shapes a vase, pot or cup that's then textured and fired for display. 
my bucket hat scatters the rain, holds my lures and helps cool off my brain. if you don't know what flies are, i'll know where your eyes are: my chapeau might be tough to explain. 
because pavement and lawns shouldn't meet, the town's finally curbing our street. hard to pose as high class when folks park on your grass. their decision, at last, is concrete. 
hey, your four-lane's shut tight up ahead; pull 'em over, peel off or you're dead. breaker, breaker, one-nine: let me in on this line, or tonight your big rig is your bed. 
i'm knocked out by a girl at the pool who's been blessed with, i'd say, every tool: killer face (big brown eyes), killer bod (oh, those thighs), and a smile that could bring down a mule. 
we're cutting you loose; you know why: you've given our firm a black eye. keeping peace with our clients takes tact and some science, not shouting, "go somewhere and die." 
this tire's bald?could mean trouble ahead, because nothing remains of the tread. if it blows at high speeds, you'll spin out in the weeds, with results perhaps best left unsaid. 
she's "old ironsides", battle-tried ship, now well-berthed in her comfortable slip: uss constitution made a great contribution. she's at rest, but retired? bite your lip! 
we decided to curtain our bed. now it's draped in translucent rose red? a nice color, in theory, but the morning light's eerie? should've chosen white netting instead. 
here's a talent i learned after school: how to bank off the cushions in pool, beat my blocked-shot travails with those rubberized rails, and stay confident, crafty? and cool. 
it's summer stock night by the lake; i've got tickets and someone to take. just a short drive upstate, so we shouldn't come late. we've an 8:30 curtain to make. 
that old hulk would look great in my yard: a de soto with fins, driven hard. but a certified check wouldn't buy the old wreck. it took cash; the guy laughed at my card. 
my club has most liberal views? seems it's prospered by breaking taboos, and its hedonist climate means every damn time it makes news, it increases its dues. 
summer sounds at the ballpark are sweet: barking vendors and cheers from each seat. then the crack of the bat leaves all other sounds flat. that sharp thwack brings the crowd to its feet. 
in pieces she came to our shore, to her spot by the great "golden door." once on site and emplaced, she was quickly embraced ? her promise too firm to ignore. 
this sample that betty's presented contains pebbles in matrix cemented: sedimentary rock, chipped off an old block? this conglomerate nature invented. 
there are three counts of rape on his sheet. don't release him; he's sure to repeat. on parole, he'd persist, and add more to his list, unencumbered and back on the street. 
it's the principal's hard and fast rule: we must not wear gang colors in school. no bandanas, no caps, so it's all under wraps? gang boxers and tats are way cool. 
that preacher's one son-of-a bitch, using words to seduce and get rich. he's a real elmer gantry: a rat in the pantry. but he's sure got one hell of a pitch. 
the old botanist, losing his grip, offered leaf lectures all through our trip. leaves are simple and round; or they're pinnate, compound; or emarginate: notched at the tip. 
always dealing in tension and sleaze, i just booked, seeking freshness and ease. i've upgraded my life with a conch for my wife: my bahamian doll in the keys. 
get yer arses in gear, lads, get cracking. i won't 'alf send the lot o' yer packing. though our sales are declining, toffs' boots still need shining. to work, boys, there's orders for blacking. 
i'm a commonplace, average joe, and i ask what "just folks" want to know. blow your top, walk away? won't affect what i say. major outlets still carry my show. 
he slid safely, stood quickly, and, yup, right on camera adjusted his cup. julie couldn't but watch as he yanked at his crotch. she was spellbound, in fact?ate it up. 
at the pool club, they've boosted my dues just to upgrade the shuffleboard cues. "lighter stick, smoother swivel"? someone bought all that drivel. it's an add-on?no way to refuse. 
you want wisdom? he'll gladly bestow it. he's facile: he speaks like a poet. but the common belief? he's a cunning old thief who will rob you, though you'll never know it. 
our divertissement's chosen for you: works our dancers are longing to do, each one short and amusing (keeps the hubbies from snoozing), and each with a fresh point of view. 
"a cricket turns runoff aside, helps your chimney take cloudbursts in stride. downward flow is deflected around?redirected." "then add one." (the roofer complied.) 
all the cultivated guests at a tea, swapping witty and chic repartee, so polite, turned away from one deb's rude display, excepting uncultured old me. 
from bushwick to flatlands to coney, often rough, but don't label it "phony"? spike lee named it "crooklyn," but to most, it's just brooklyn. nevuh hoid it? ya fulla baloney! 
she's coding! quick, call for the cart; the paddles might jump-start her heart. then pray for the best? she's so young to arrest, and it's massive; it's well off the chart. 
i don't crave macedonian lamb. when you cook for me, keep it bonne femme, 'cause it's simple and plain ? that's how god made the rain. how prosaic? well, that's what i am. 
build a pipeline? no way ? it'll leak. she wears fibers, 'cause leather's not chic. and her glare of reproach when i murdered that roach? she's a humorless, firm eco freak. 
when, each morning, my workload deflates me, consuetudinary greeting awaits me: hot coffee, warm smile, routinely, with style. but i'm sure every manager hates me. 
some bearings emblazon our shield: a bend sinister crosses the field twixt an armor-clad knee and a large silver key. thus our clan's checkered past is revealed. 
concavities dappled his face, left by acne, a rather bad case. though we dubbed him "judd crater" he wasn't a hater. instead, he showed humor and grace. 
no capsules: i choke and get queasy. find pills that dissolve, and i'm easy? some disintegrable med that won't mess with my head. help me quick, doc. i'm dopey and sneezy. 
boston latin's a school with tradition? one reason kids long for admission. the curriculum's hard, but next stop's harvard yard, and at latin they ask no tuition. 
when limos roll up, she'll be there, with her emulously envious stare. oh, to live like a star: trendy threads, flashy car, and adored. but the world isn't fair. 
treated roughly, then stashed and ignored, she needs loving, this model t ford. i'll step up to the plate and revive the old crate. i won't rest till she's fully restored. 
when expecting a hard, bumpy trip, wooden boxing's the best way to ship. so i'm crating my treasures (the most prudent of measures). but these freight rates?my husband will flip! 
party leadership's known for excelling? their procedures long-proven, compelling: aligning all factions with back room transactions, but the texas contingent's rebelling. 
due considerance, sir's what we ask: a few shillings, some mutton, a cask. ain't it comin' our way after drudgin' all day? think it over; we're done wit' your task. 
an emergency medical technician responds quickly, before a physician. his rapid arrival often impacts survival. he's a man on a critical mission. 
no support, no respect ? there's a cost: once he taught and was loved; now he's lost. just this burnout remains of his passions and pains, and those insults, attacks ? he'll be tossed. 
passers-by turned away in disgust as she gummed at the stale, darkened crust. clearly famished, she fed on the trashed hunk of bread. feral humans are forced to adjust. 
in late autumn came grandpa's advice: "don't be fooled by that thin crust of ice. 'cause it ain't gonna hold, and that pond water's cold." i knew better? and paid a stiff price. 
this here's dogpatch, of yokum renown, prototypical hillbilly town. kinda hatched by al capp, sorter slides round the map? it's hwar daisy cain't pin abner down. 
my home's in east georgia?savannah, yet my passion is edwardiana: that's attire post-victoria. i haunt clothing emporia calcutta to copacabana. 
he's just dumped her with everyone there; so public it's too much to bear. she's left shaken and crushed. conversation grows hushed? one more life left in sad disrepair. 
please recognize what has occurred: his control on your world is absurd. though at first just your teacher, he's made you his creature, dependent on his every word. 
that's a creeper: his plumage, reserved, and his beak is turned down or decurved. scouring trees at the park, he pries bugs from their bark. yummy grubs in this crack: dinner's served. 
trade in ivory's widely restricted, with eburnean goods interdicted. still, for credulous asses, one more elephant passes. the poachers are rarely convicted. 
there's a cliff by a steep mountain curve where the view causes drivers to swerve. to avoid a sad end at this breathtaking bend, pull over, step out, then observe. 
shooting trophies comes easy, indeed; lazy hunters get all that they need. countless killings await; daily bags will be great. at the game ranch, it's all guaranteed. 
slowly stretching at stress points, like these, my best work clothes adopt by degrees. the weave loosens at points, as at big, bony joints? these are comfortably bagged at the knees. 
academically, he's but a crewman, an apprentice, a true catechumen. if it's not over-reaching, his dreams are of teaching, but his workload, for now, is inhuman. 
as i lie in the dark and unwind, present hopes become sharply defined. i'm at last reassured that today we were cured. each sweet moment comes back to my mind. 
while the bonus you've offered him's fine, and a tempting enticement to sign, if he's benched and ignored once you've lured him on board, he may wither, i fear, on the vine. 
pictorial stamp cancellation: what a strange philatelic fixation! it's a flag or a goose, or it's bullwinkle moose recalled with a graphic ovation. 
he keeps floating along with his crowd; deviation is never allowed. now lethargic, now swift, with its current he'll drift, and wherever it takes him, he's proud. 
on her countenance, everything sags, upper cheeks given over to bags? sort of wrinkled and loose. hubby heaps on abuse, so, for vengeance, she ceaselessly nags. 
what the interstates crisscross today once were barriers blocking the way. oxen dragged through high passes at the speed of molasses to desert, distress and dismay. 
she's high-tech and well-armed, and she's sleek. her commissioning's early next week. this american beauty will soon be on duty securing the seas for the meek. 
that's no diamond; they scammed you?that's rough; california has loads of the stuff. it's colemanite, moron, a prime source of boron. take my word; i'm a death valley buff. 
though her beauty inspires devotion, she's fathomless, cool as the ocean? squally-wild or genteel. not a snatch of her's real, as she counterfeits every emotion. 
tracking trends, we lay bare the concealed, and through language our culture's revealed. terms may flourish and spread; others quickly drop dead: culturomics, a word-counting field. 
there's a chance that he's fractured his neck, a cervical vertebra. check for numbness and pain. keep him stable; constrain him right there on his back on your deck. 
chocolate-coat them; they'll sell by the ton. label "limited"?double the fun. they'll seduce, just like booze; dubbed "enrobed," they can't lose. but you can't leave them out in the sun. 
gorgeous view! all were fully enthralled. cousin jethro peered 'round us and drawled, "look, this peak's been swept clean, not a tree to be seen? to us locals, this mountain's a bald." 
she faked sick once; you felt like a fool, but this wheezing and coughing ? not cool. it's no act just to dupe us. she's critically croupous. she needs treatment; don't send her to school. 
great speech, sir, i'm sure all were stirred. all the honors have now been conferred. splendid words and bouquets, but you promised a raise: time to show you're as good as your word. 
my son brings his friends up to date, introduces the family slate: "the nice lady's my mother, and that's my big brother." big, in this case: age six, three-foot-eight. 
this architect's crowning creation, when seen in this great elevation, is a work of perfection. from any direction, it's splendid, from dome to foundation. 
i'd compare you with summertime rain. you're both moist, but i wouldn't complain. with moods hard to confine: though  you rumble, you shine? now pounding, now soft and mundane. 
packed in sawdust, so nothing should chip, all our glassware's in casks on the ship. our bone china's stowed, too. clipper's laded; we're through. treasures barreled, we're set for the trip. 
epicurean tastes are expensive: i want wine lists refined and extensive, and i've always resented meals poorly presented. food lifelessly served is offensive. 
thus wrote gilbert: "oh, bother the flowers?" pester tulips? beyond human powers. what he meant was, "to hell with 'em." my advice: "spend a spell with 'em. settle down and enjoy them for hours." 
hung with curtains of fast-melting ice is this road cut through dark banded gneiss? metamorphically made, now cut through and displayed. speeding drivers pass by in a trice. 
folks feel heavy from bagels. instead, we'll go crunchy and small with our bread, adding fruit trays and wine? it all falls into line. buy some bagel chips; i'll make a spread. 
that big shipment can start our boutique, and the balance arrives late next week. tribeca's next thing has today taken wing, clientele lining up as we speak. 
i cook dishes with rice as a base, some so spicy they'll crimson your face. suffused with great flavor, rice works in my favor. supportive, my rice knows its place. 
belligerently primed for a fight, all awaited the first streaks of light. before dawn came the thunder; hostile hearts filled with wonder: were the gods crossing swords out of sight? 
she's a casual, passing on through, in her backpack's a trick? maybe two. she won't pause here to spawn. before long, she'll move on. have your fun, son; you're long overdue. 
we'll rely on economy of scale: produce more, boost our profit per sale, exploit market voracity, expand our capacity, move the product at stores and by mail. 
paul poops parties; his temperament's poor: starts to gripe when he steps through the door, with his carps and complaints unrepressed by restraints? he's the pleasure-polluter du jour. 
with reluctance, i chinned the old strad, a great legacy left by my dad. then i started to play, and my doubts fell away. guess we fit; we're not sounding half bad. 
my cringe was a hard thing to hide when i caught cousin kurt with ben's bride. shivers ran through my skin; i drew back, turtled in, shut my eyes and slipped slowly outside. 
a dutch angle horizon's not true, out of kilter and shot upward too? say from under a desk? it's distorted, grotesque. and we sense something weird will ensue. 
one more lie, frank, you're right back in jail. our procedure's ideal; it can't fail: this elective brain surgery terminates perjury? what's the matter, big frank? you look pale. 
in her library, minnie found peace when consumed by the cultures of greece. but those great ways have left; she's confused and bereft, so she turns to her cups for surcease. 
please list all of his contacts this week, and discreetly, please?don't let this leak. though your husband's contagious, you must be courageous: containment's the goal that we seek. 
will my gardens spring back and endure? many potherbs sprout blossoms, mature. like some dry, bitter weed, they'll soon bolt: go to seed ? next year's herbs for our table secure. 
this diner food's more than all right, but i'm large and their booth seats are tight. guess the patrons seem cool, so i'll climb on a stool. i'll be served at the counter tonight. 
what a shame! twenty years on the job, and this cop's on the pad for the mob. would you look what he's done? the poor fool ate his gun: blew his head off. i pity the slob. 
something stirs me? there's nobody there; still that scent fills the ambient air: there's an aura around me. has annabel found me? have the angels at last heard my prayer? 
the craft service puts out the snacks, bottled water and cold cuts in stacks. so performers and crew have their cake, eat it too, while the dolly grips lay some more tracks. 
some folks take a broad view of things; they accept what each day's sunrise brings: what, new "rejects" next door? sudanese civil war? life goes on till the fat lady sings. 
in two seconds, a setting's erased. with a clock wipe, the scene is replaced: second hand sweeps around and the film's on new ground? gives a place change an odd, vintage taste. 
mount the tire, pump the air ? no big deal. the bead pops and you're sure there's a seal; fool pumps on, doesn't stop; there's a boom!!! (not a pop). damned mechanic: asleep at the wheel. 
rough-cut dailies are anxiously viewed by directors, to learn where they're screwed: the scene's playing too long, and the chemistry's wrong. they'll reshoot or come blithely unglued. 
gotham stoop: a girl weeps, uncontrolled; snowy podunk: folks hustle through cold; restless mob at a train: break them up, cue the rain. backlot crises are always controlled. 
with ambient, no tapping feet, and no melody's there to repeat. it's all atmosphere, mood, written not to intrude. it's pure background?subdued and discreet. 
did the keeper of eddystone light hook a mermaid one dark cornish night? did she give birth to three on this rock in the sea? if it's so, then the shanty is right. 
our dairy guy stocks all our juice, and cold cuts and custards and mousse, eggs, hummus and oleo? an expanding portfolio. you thought dairy means "milk?" silly goose! 
he dismounted and knelt in the field, his fealty boldly revealed. in the midst of the siege shone the marks of his liege, emblazoned in gold on his shield. 
"western europe's corrupt and decayed. we've gone soft; evil's sure to invade. and our ills are endemic," said his strident polemic, "in our soil, in our souls?be afraid!" 
crew, that nudist's packed up; she's long gone. back to business: it's time we sailed on. steady, lad! even keel? keep your hands on that wheel, and first mate, kindly take the damned conn! 
"collaborationist!" ? cries from the crowd, "you're a turncoat, you snake! are you proud? you fell under their spell; now you'll go straight to hell. a red flag's gonna serve as your shroud." 
a brass ring's like a real pot o' gold that says, "grab me! be daring and bold." so i've had a few whacks, slipped and fell through the cracks. for the present, my gold is on hold. 
reminded of dates in my youth, at a diner, i ask for a booth: facing benches, a table? my choice when i'm able? diner counters attract the uncouth. 
his whole face, due to cicatrization, seemed embossed with his tribe's variation: long raised welts on the skin from his pate to his chin, like some gruesome engraved invitation. 
"morning," she said, and "how do?" with a smile, so her warmth would come through. when she spoke, it was clipped, tender, sweet, honey-dipped. and mom's best brachyology? "nu?" 
coming gropingly forth from the dark, it was soon an emerging young market. our commercial relations with burgeoning nations: "here's my ride, kid?find somewhere to park it." 
try our latest, potage v?ronique. it's a flavorful soup, but it's weak. our sous-chef has a scheme: he'll enrich it with cream? thicker soups are in vogue now, tr?s chic. 
she clawed me?i'm sure there'll be scars, crowned me twice, and i'm still seeing stars: on my pate with a pan, then a campbell's soup can. that spitfire belongs behind bars. 
a long battery of tests lies before us with committees of scholars to score us. we hope, once we're through with this grueling review, that the ivies won't choose to ignore us. 
for a copper or two, she would sing? not too dear for the pleasures she'd bring. and she wasn't half willing for a toff with a shilling to perform the gent's own "special thing." 
i'll closet myself with my work like some wretched dickensian clerk. walled-off from my buddies, just me and my studies, i'll learn it?or?snap!?go berserk. 
us open: queens hosts the elites; can't believe what they're getting for seats. but the average clown cannot drive across town: event traffic is choking the streets. 
here's perplexity: gather around, for within, leonard cohen is found. he's an angst-ridden poet (read his works, and you'll know it) who's adored by the rich and renowned. 
have a burger with cheese on your diet? you're breaking me up?you're a riot! guess i misunderstood, but that did my heart good. you were kidding, of course; don't deny it. 
draw the cork and decant a red wine, let it breathe a few minutes ? then dine. let your company savor that exquisite flavor. choose them well: cast no pearls before swine. 
come and see me; we need to touch base. let me brief you in depth, face to face, on our markets, connections and likely defections before you take over this place. 
there are blessings a garden bestows: i'm at prayer; something kisses my nose. some soft scent fills the chapel. someone's peeling an apple? no, it's eglantine, sweet-briar rose. 
his kaleidoscope stagings of dance were his signature?that, and romance. busby'd showcase girls' faces and legs in odd spaces. want flesh, boys? well, here's an expanse. 
i'm impressed by that latest degree. her cv's a bit weak, but we'll see ? last night was enjoyable. sure, she's employable. a pity it's not up to me. 
we were buffing our favorite piece when dad said, "life's about elbow grease": of the mind, of the heart ? work it in, do your part. the rewards will be sweet, so don't cease. 
when you're fission (a popular sport), use debate, or you'll find you're caught short. dig some up; just go vermin ? keep them squiggly and squirmin' ? or buy blood worms in town by deport. 
during dark times, mom turned us toward light, weaving visions to fend off the night. we would sleep safe and sound when our mom was around. in her care, futures always looked bright. 
in their tunnels, they nest by a stream, and each evening swoop down where bugs teem. beginning each spring, watch them hunt on the wing. bank swallows are bug nuts supreme. 
here's the trade-off: you'll build my new racks, and your shindig? i'll cater the snacks. both our problems are solved without money involved. bartered services circumvent tax. 
my wife's sweet, yet she never excites me, but parenting?sure, that invites me: kids are fun. sex? a yawn, so i contract don juan. but they've gone. now and then, my wife writes me. 
the award of an edgar implies that the writer's reached personal highs, that her mystery writing is fresh and exciting. her readers will want a reprise. 
this silver's been masterfully chased: hammered shapes in such delicate taste, with a tapped-in tight weave? it's so hard to believe it was made to receive human waste. 
"fully churned-over land gets well aired? improves plantings," the farmer declared. "no more time to be killing; my acres need tilling, 'cause cultivated soil's well prepared." 
vinnie needs telling off, there's no doubt, but you're hiding downstairs working out. punching bag in your basement? we call it displacement. confront him? no way ? he's got clout. 
losing currency lately, i find, is the gentler phrase, "kiss my behind." on my home tv screen, baser phrasing's routine, its employers no longer maligned. 
"we can cure an assortment of ills at our clinic ensconced in the hills." tempting ad?it looked swell, but i'm still sick as hell. six months later, i keep getting bills. 
our fruit's fresh, so we've no competition; we remove what's in doubtful condition. daily sorting's dead dull. still, we can't sell the cull, so it's picked up each day by the mission. 
while our lifestyles pursue an aesthetic that's subtle, relaxed and poetic, and we're calm, easy-going, earth's tectonically growing. her uplift is endogenetic. 
at the mike, a deranged right-wing nut linked the pope with the spreading of smut. his emotional zeal had a potent appeal: demagogical speech hits one's gut. 
she goes hunting used pop cans all day: loads of empties she's stashing away. she's been cramming her closets with nickel deposits. she'll redeem them. well, some day, she may. 
on the pitch, every player competes, yet we'd suffered a string of defeats. then an off-the-wall claim said our boots were to blame, so we all bought expensive blue cleats. 
my restaurant's small, but it's hot. it's the theater crowd's favorite spot. sure, it's got its detractors, but the critics and actors come to gab, grab a bite and just squat. 
we can lever the lid from below, prise it up with my cast-iron crow. i'm aware how it looks: crows are tools used by crooks. it's effective?that's all you need know. 
'neath a boulder, a towering pillar of clay was a set for a thriller: at this demoiselle was a fight; the stone fell? demoiselle then became lady killer. 
make a change, 'cause you're going to pot. you should crew for a time on my yacht: get in shape, learn the sails; see the world from my rails. and you'd have your own cabin?why not? 
if i'm done with the rat-race?frenetic, and my decor's quite spartan?ascetic, why this beautiful wife at the core of my life? for a grace that transcends the cosmetic. 
his writings depict what's inherent in humans, worthwhile and aberrant. why study the skies? study other men's eyes, thought bruce chatwin, philosopher errant. 
both young boxers looked seasoned and mean. my instructions to them were routine: "you expect a fair shake, so no blows in a break. keep your punches up, boys, and fight clean." 
this table-top's eglomise? reverse-painted?a subtle display: maidens lounging in grass. something wafts through the glass: a delicate floral bouquet. 
our new goalie came cheap at the price. on each shot, tight as white is on rice, he maneuvers and blocks in the red-bordered box. in his crease, he's the king of the ice. 
as air's forced past your teeth, that brief hum from your larynx is helpful. how come? it's required ? indicative of a voiced dental fricative. sans that hum, either's ether, old chum. 
here, eelgrass grows close by the shore, feeding wigeons and geese, and, what's more, it's a nursery site for young fish, and just might stuff your cushions. it's tough to ignore. 
i'm returnin' myself to the farm with my bodyboard under my arm. 'druther burrow through caves than go surfin' those waves ? rowdy water? i don't see the charm. 
ever fluid, she's always in motion. destination? she hasn't a notion. she gathers the rain, carries on, won't complain, till she empties herself in the ocean. 
though their colors and size may attract us, promulgation's uncertain in practice. pollen's spread by a bat, and that's how it's begat: bright red dragon fruit, spawned by a cactus. 
our patience, this summer, was tested: first the campgrounds?mosquito infested, so we fled for the ocean. (was that everyone's notion?) all roads to the shore were congested. 
it's a painting about conversation? bluebloods met for a group rumination. this piece is quite formal for a subject so normal, pulled from life, yet with no animation. 
i booked an exclusive hotel, called elitist and choosy as hell. still, how posh could it be if it rented to me? i canceled?low-class clientele. 
her guy's vulgar, uncouth and a pain? a vast rock pile in search of a brain. soon they'll run out of gas, 'cause her tastes are first class: he's a beer, but she's clearly champagne. 
i've a bend on my shield; it's oblique? cuts across like a sundering streak, walls the charges apart. with traditional art, coats of arms come with heaps of mystique. 
"leave the lights on? that's torture, you brute!" maybe so, but consider the boot: wedge it tighter; he'll beg ? slowly crush a man's leg. is that torture? not much to dispute. 
my lines? had them cold in a snap, but my blocking? just hand me a map. upstage left or down right, i'm befuddled, in spite of the hours? what i need is a nap. 
we have blackouts built in to our act. they're amusingly quick and compact. and to heighten their clout, each concludes with lights out. humor's broad ? nothing deep or abstract. 
edward longshanks, subduer of wales, helmed destroyer of blood-spattered tales, would  lay waste to the north, far beyond firth of forth. but he faltered, and scotland prevails. 
call me common? i'm sure that's not fair: to announce when one farts is quite rare. oh, you're claiming i'm low. let me prove it ain't so? i'll fart proudly from high on that chair. 
scattered body parts strewn here and there would have curled any normal man's hair. but from one jaded cop, grisly humor, nonstop: "i get paid by the piece, i don't care." 
what an eyeful! so what, she's not smart? she's a beauty who'll tear men apart. call her agent and cast her, today, if not faster. that bimbo is state of the art. 
"why jump canyons? the risks are too great. it's your life, but you're just tempting fate." i was wasting my breath; he kept dancing with death. he's stopped dancing: he's lying in state. 
castle holidays? sure, let's begin. all those slots served the archers within. needing glassed-in embrasures, we'll hire a few glaziers. slap a roof on, and guests will pour in. 
i've learned to shut up and hold tight, since her rages just last overnight. they set in without warning, and pass before morning ? she's blessedly calm by first light. 
his responses, at first, were evasive? dodged the question and then grew abrasive. so we wined him and dined him; this morning we signed him. we've found graciousness often persuasive. 
what a bio! her training's extensive: wide ranging and quite comprehensive. so email that letter and hope that we get her. be warned, though, the gal comes expensive. 
the navy meant faraway places? exotic the sounds and the faces, djibouti to nome? now mom's welcomed me home with a hug and, "son, do up your laces." 
she's onstage every night?an exotic, stripping slowly?profoundly erotic. her revealing ballets with rewarding displays are unfailingly hot and hypnotic. 
since that day he was sent to deploy, mom's had visions of holding her boy. the long struggle is done, and they'll send home her son. mom's euphorically dancing for joy. 
her achievements were simply historic. reaction? we all were euphoric? ecstatic with pride. now we'll cling to her side: her ascent will be swift, meteoric. 
conflagration! one's lost?it's the sitter. so bag her; she's one crispy critter: charred beyond recognition, id'd by dentition. dark humor can shock and embitter. 
his integrity's under a cloud. one night out with that ostracized crowd led to vilification: he caved to temptation, and finds himself spurned, disavowed. 
our town council is thought to mean well. their events, though, are boring as hell. a conciliar meeting is best when it's fleeting, but their motto is "sit for a spell." 
she answered, definitively, "no! not a chance, not a prayer; i won't go. just to freeze in the bleachers with beer-benumbed creatures, i should squat all that time in the snow?" 
oh, crap! ? good, i've got your attention. ecphonema's a tactic worth mention. cut an air of stagnation with a sharp exclamation, and break free of ennui?or ease tension. 
when a pilot has trouble with attitude, his craft won't allow him much latitude. but once pitch, yaw and roll are back under control, we applaud him with deeply felt gratitude. 
what a landing?courageous and heady! still, the aftermath's left him unsteady: constant autograph-seekers, long dinners with speakers (he's been banqueted six times already). 
that carpetbagger ran on her fame: she moved in, won on hubby's big name, outmaneuvered the rules, played the voters for fools. in her business, it's all in the game. 
manning triremes in old roman wars were synched rowers in three banks of oars. triple tiers produced speed; they were fearsome, indeed, when they loomed off an enemy's shores. 
damned lawmakers failed to come through. checkoff's gone; we'll lose membership too. when those guys we endorsed told us dues can't be forced? that's a message we won't misconstrue. 
"there's a secret built in to this game," said the rumors, the game's claim to fame. who uncovers the code wins a golden commode, so this easter egg hunt's your true aim. 
manufacturing? asia's the place, while collapse stares the west in the face. western plants are outmoded; equipment's corroded: an eroded industrial base. 
here the esplanade borders the shore, couples strolling where we strolled before. my old thoughts come back clearly, how i suffered severely: "my lord, but this woman's a bore!" 
past the tree line, where wind often moans, there are chilling, unwelcoming zones. in these high, gusty passes, anemious grasses find life in the chinks of the stones. 
to the cytopathologist, cells have a theme; there's a story each tells. might a dancer have cancer? he'll help find the answer. i read books; this guy reads organelles. 
i'm pleased with our latest au pair. her demeanor's a breath of fresh air. before her, miss grumpy was peevish and frumpy. let's face it, she didn't compare. 
"got some agita? tummy distressed? eat eupeptic food?helps you digest." her advice should be banned; that stuff's boring and bland. she'll survive me?embittered, suppressed. 
once i thought i was tough and hard nosed, but this gig's left me overexposed? a clay pigeon each day. make it all go away! umping kids? (resignation's enclosed.) 
seems the town's had a hell of a fright: some damned killer broke free at first light. still, the deputy's shot him; they've just about got him. watch his capture?replayed?late tonight. 
our big hair house?it really looks great: columns, statues, a huge gilded gate. that's the lottery money i've spent for my honey. we've named it the screw-you estate. 
it's crib time, so what's in our bags? cut lunches with sammos and snags. that'll do, so we grin, 'cause it's time to bog in, have a yack and then hand round the fags. 
put your workaday world in suspension; something desperately needs your attention. this exigent matter wants action, not chatter? employ that old ounce of prevention. 
edulcorate wilson?he's gruff; to approach him's increasingly tough. we should dampen his fires; he frightens new hires. we're paying the bastard enough. 
fortune's fools, sailors carp and complain and appeal to st. elmo in vain. but we're half o'er from guam, drifting still in a calm, we want wind, lord, and please, send us rain. 
sudden fungi, erumpent today, broke the soil in their sylvan display on the moist forest floor, where they weren't before. catch the show; they'll enjoy a brief stay. 
she's the loudmouth at every affair; you can't miss her?the broad with big hair (it's teased up in a pile, her idea of "high style"), and a lover beyond all compare. 
she's our epoch's most glorious flower; the greats flock to her, hour by hour: an eximious crowd, by their maker endowed with vast intellect, talent and power. 
"that's my mare; let's discuss how much hay she ate. wasteful? i'll tell you?the way she ate!" name a thing, he'll expound on it, perhaps wax profound on it. any subject at hand, he'll expatiate. 
stop the presses! we've got an exclusive: a new photo of author elusive. our stringer who shot it says only we got it; the author was crude and abusive. 
as though etherized, zonked, on a table, he lies still on the floor of the stable. out cold, he's been thrown? not so much as a groan. doctor's coming? as soon as he's able. 
dermatoscopy checks out one's skin, seeking cancerous lesions within. using polarized light, it reveals (or it might) melanoma or something akin. 
we're surprised by some renegade sioux: are there injured? surprisingly few. we've lost horses; that's fair, 'cause they've left us our hair and gained honor by just counting coup. 
it's colonized much of the land, and continues to spread, to expand. no control's guaranteed; still, we fight the damned weed. stupid kudzu is way out of hand. 
a porter's not paid what he's worth; for a tip, he'll move heaven and earth. tough to sleep on a train? pullman bunks are a pain? pay the man; he'll procure a new berth. 
we took hayrides each fall, camped each summer. now our seasons grow grayer and glummer. since our kids both moved out, there's a stimulus drought ? this empty nest syndrome's a bummer! 
kind of makes me go green 'round the gills how they've levelled some forests and hills so investors could build up that land with malls filled up with crap. now we can't pay our bills. 
we'd been slogging all day, so we rested, but the lowlands were rank and infested. we regrouped and kept pressing, climbed up (what a blessing) to the top of a ridge?yes, we crested. 
with no fanfare, back home and at ease, mom breezed in, like god's breath through the trees. won't explain why she left, why she left us bereft ? just says, "love comes with no guarantees." 
she's been married four times, has my wife; i've been there through her trials and strife. now my turn's come around and i'll keep her, i'm bound. oh, those legs ? like a fine duncan phyfe. 
you know what i hate? tempting fate: my new girl's absolutely first-rate. she walks in, shows her face; every creep in the place starts amorously eyeing my date. 
sunday dinners?those memories are sweet? table center: a mountain of meat on mom's twenty-inch charger (do plates come any larger?) and gramps half-asleep in his seat. 
damned colonials mocked us today: blew our armory, melted away. yankee doodles won't fight, but they're out there all right: a provokingly guileful display.
